                moving on. In a field in the countryside they might notice some cows. In the same
                field, Christopher would memorize the exact number of cows, their colors, and their

                outside a café and does a problem called “Conway’s Soldiers” in his head to calm

                to pay for the trip. The policeman escorts him to a cash machine, where Christopher
                withdraws fifty pounds. After the policeman points him to the ticket window,

                foot in front of the other while saying out loud “left, right, left, right.” He

                draw a map back to it, or remember its location. The object physically exists in
                space where you left it. But time is the relationship between events and is not a
                fixed relationship. If you travel near the speed of light in a spaceship you may
                come back to find that everyone you know is dead, while you remain young. If you get
                lost in a desert you are in a desert, but if you get lost in time you are nowhere at

Though Blomkvist acknowledges that their relationship will never produce marriage or children, he takes pride in their mutual creation: Millennium. He views Millennium as integral to future of investigative journalism and prefers to sacrifice what remains of his own career to save the magazine.

Henrik explains that though several people saw Harriet both at the parade and after the accident, she never made it to dinner that evening. Henrik believes that someone in the Vanger family must have killed her, since the island was closed off to outsiders by the accident and no one could enter or leave unnoticed. The story shifts back to Salander, who finishes one of Blomkvist’s books. Then, as part of her work for Milton Security and the client Frode, she goes to scope out Wennerström’s apartment building.

                    as a stylist for the Hunger Games, and to Katniss’s surprise, he requested the
                    tributes of the impoverished District 12. It is typical for the tributes to
                    dress in a style that reflects their district, and Cinna says since District
                    12’s industry is coal mining, Katniss’s and Peeta’s costumes will reflect coal’s
                    main function, which is to burn. Her costume will be lit with a synthetic flame,
                    and Cinna calls her “the girl who was on fire.” In their matching costumes—an
                    unusual touch as tributes are rarely made to match—Katniss and Peeta are
                    escorted to a main plaza in the city, where they will go before the huge

                    outsmarted the other tributes. That night, Thresh’s picture is projected in the
                    sky. Thresh is dead, and the news upsets Katniss. If they didn’t win, she wanted
                    Thresh to, because he let her live and because of Rue. Only Foxface and Cato
                    remain. Katniss and Peeta sleep in shifts, and when Peeta wakes Katniss he
                    offers her some bread with goat cheese and apples. They make tarts like that at
                    his family’s bakery, but they can’t afford to eat them. They mostly eat the
                    stale leftovers. Katniss is surprised. She always thought the shopkeepers had

                    what’s on the far side of the circle where the Cornucopia is, where Thresh
                    stays. Peeta says it’s a field of shoulder-high grass. It makes him uneasy
                    thinking about what can hide in there. Peeta’s description reminds Katniss of
                    what they’re taught about the woods outside District 12, and she compares Peeta
                    to Gale. While Peeta is not a coward, there are things he’s never questioned,
                    like what the woods are really like. Gale questions everything. Katniss makes a
                    joke about knocking Peeta out, and when Peeta becomes genuinely upset that she
                    risked her life, she decides to use the romantic tension between them in the
                    hopes of getting more gifts from Haymitch. But as she does this, she realizes
                    she truly cares for Peeta. When they kiss, Katniss describes it as the first
                    that both are fully aware of. Neither is sick or dazed by injury, and it’s the
                    first kiss that makes her want another. Because of the cold, they share the
                    sleeping bag again, and Peeta puts his arms around her. It’s the closest she’s
                    ever felt to him, and nobody has made her feel so safe since her father

                    is dragged into the Cornucopia. Night falls, and still no cannon announces his
                    death. They can hear Cato moaning as the muttations work away at him, but
                    Katniss knows they won't kill him. The Gamemakers want to prolong the gruesome
                    spectacle for the viewers. Peeta, meanwhile, is bleeding heavily from the wound

                view. Zaman says he can do nothing against the Taliban, and it is the only way to
                get money to feed the children. He tells Amir and Farid that the official took

                guards make Sohrab dance until the Taliban official orders them to leave. While the

                Assef used to call Ali, and Amir realizes that the Taliban official is actually
                Assef. Stunned, Amir says he will pay him for the boy. Assef replies that money is
                irrelevant and not why he joined the Taliban. He tells Amir he was once imprisoned,
                and one evening a guard began kicking him until the blows dislodged a kidney stone

                Hassan openly, he felt guilty and took it out on Amir, whom Baba thought of as his
                socially legitimate half. But real good came from Baba’s remorse, Rahim Khan says. The orphanage Baba built, the poor that he fed, were his way of redeeming himself. Rahim Khan also leaves Amir a key to a safe-deposit box with money to cover Amir’s
                expenses. He has little time left, he writes, and Amir should not look for him. The
                next morning, Amir gives Farid the names of the American couple that runs the

of an Umuofia tribesman while she was in their market. The crowd
expresses anger and indignation, and Okonkwo travels to Mbaino to

must go to war, and Umuofia has a fierce reputation for its skill
in war and magic. Okonkwo is chosen to represent his clan because
he is its fiercest warrior. Earlier in the chapter, as he remembers
his past victories, we learn about the five human heads that he
has taken in battle. On important occasions, he drinks palm-wine
from the first head that he captured. Not surprisingly, Mbaino agrees
to Umuofia’s terms. The elders give the virgin to Ogbuefi

means, “Death, I implore you,” and “Ozoemena,” which means, “May
it not happen again.” Okonkwo consulted a medicine man who told
him that an ogbanje was tormenting them. An ogbanje is
a “wicked” child who continually re-enters its mother’s womb only
to die again and again, causing its parents grief. A medicine man
mutilated the dead body of Ekwefi’s third child to discourage the ogbanje’s
return. When Ezinma was born, like most ogbanje children,
she suffered many illnesses, but she recovered from all of them. A year before the start of the novel, when Ezinma was nine, a medicine
man named Okagbue Uyanwa found her iyi-uwa, the small,
buried pebble that is the ogbanje’s physical link
to the spirit world. Although the discovery of the iyi-uwa ought

that Uzowulu must beg Mgbafo to return to him. If she agrees, the

reflects on the boy’s life, cut short. He looks at the boy’s sunken
chest and delicate fingers and wonders if he was a scholar. He imagines
that the other boys at school might have teased this boy because
he may have had a woman’s walk and a love for mathematics. A butterfly
lands on the corpse’s cheek, which causes O’Brien to notice the
undamaged nose. Despite Kiowa’s urging to pull himself together,
to talk about it, and to stop staring at the body, O’Brien cannot
do so. Kiowa confesses that maybe he doesn’t understand what O’Brien
is going through, but he rationalizes that the young man was carrying

platoon, separated into two-man teams, moved into the ambush site
outside My Khe. O’Brien, teamed up with Kiowa, noticed dawn breaking slowly,
in slivers. As Kiowa slept, O’Brien, fighting off mosquitoes, saw
a young soldier wearing an ammunition belt coming out of the fog. The only reality O’Brien could feel was the sour nervousness in his
stomach, and without thinking, he pulled the key in the grenade before
he realized what he was doing. When the grenade bounced, the young
man dropped his weapon and began to run. He then hesitated and tried
to cover his head—only then did O’Brien realize that the man was
about to die. The grenade went off and the man fell on his back,

it mattered. Even now, twenty years later, he still hasn’t finished
sorting it out. He says that he sees the young man coming through
the fog sometimes when he’s reading the newspaper or sitting alone. He imagines the young man walking up the trail, passing him, smiling at

water gun. He comes home every night stinking of pig and drives
around town aimlessly, paralyzed, wondering how to find a way out
of his situation. It seems to him that there is no easy way out. The government won’t allow him to defer in order to go to graduate
school; he can’t oppose the war as a matter of general principle
because he does agree with war in some circumstances; and he can’t
claim ill health as an excuse. He resents his hometown for making

a river called the Song Tra Bong. One day, Eddie Diamond, the highest ranking
man in his company and a pleasure-seeker, jokingly suggests that
the area is so unguarded and seemingly safe that you could even
bring a girl to the camp there. A younger medic, Mark Fossie, seems
interested in the idea and goes off to write a letter. Six weeks later,
his elementary school sweetheart, Mary Anne Bell, arrives, carried
in by helicopter with a resupply shipment. Fossie explains that
getting her to camp was difficult but not impossible and for the next
two weeks, they carry on like school children. Mary Anne is curious
and a fast learner—she picks up some Vietnamese and learns how to
cook. When four casualties come in, she isn’t afraid to tend to

                    madrassas, or conservative religious schools, are being built
                in Pakistan by followers of Wahhabism, an ultra-conservative form of Sunni Islam. Because the madrassas are free, many parents send their young boys
                there, and while some provide a good education, many of the schools focus on
                training their students for militant jihad (armed struggle). Much
                has changed in Pakistan during the previous year. General Pervez Musharraf has
                become leader of the country, which is now under martial law. Musharraf’s government
                is cracking down on corruption, and one of his associates, Brigadier General Bashir
                Baz, has begun to provide occasional flights for Mortenson. On September 9,
                Mortenson sets out for the village of Zuudkhan to inaugurate three CAI-funded
                projects. While traveling he learns from Bashir that Ahmed Shah Massoud, a
                charismatic leader of the resistance against the Taliban in Afghanistan, has been

                also realizes that many of the villagers suffer from malnutrition and from various

                took up climbing. He rapidly became an expert, learning all he could about the

16938,3 of 5 What is a major reason for the continuing conflict between Pakistan and India?,"Chapter 17 begins with Fatima Batool describing the fighting that occurs
                during the “Kargil Conflict” between India and Pakistan in 1999. Her sister is
                killed, and Fatima’s family is among many displaced from their homes and forced to a
                camp on the outskirts of Skardu. When the refugees receive no help from the
                Pakistani government or from relief agencies, Syed Abbas approaches Mortenson to
                help provide fresh water. The CAI also builds a school for the girls in the
                settlement. While in Skardu, Mortenson stays as usual at the Indus Hotel, and is
                invited by two men of the Taliban to join them for a conversation. One expresses his
                admiration for Bill Clinton, who sent troops to Bosnia to intervene in the killing
                of Muslims by Christian Serbians. The book also explains that, since the time when
                the British pulled out of the Indian subcontinent and divided the region into
                predominately Muslim Pakistan and predominately Hindu India, Pakistan and India have
                been fighting over the territory of Kashmir. That’s because India, with its greater
                military force, controls most of the area, even though Kashmir is mostly Muslim. In
                1971, the two nations established a Line of Control that each side agrees not to
                cross, but each continues to fight from its side of the line with artillery fire. As
                the chapter ends, Fatima has reached the fifth grade, and the cherry trees she
                remembered from her home are now also growing in Skardu.",Religion,Human rights,The Kashmir region,The Partition,2

                first he has trouble attracting audiences. At one appearance, he sets up 200 chairs
                but only a few people show, though one leaves a check for $20,000. Eventually he
                gets some media coverage, and his talks become packed. When not traveling, Mortenson
                retreats to his Montana home. Members of the CAI board are concerned about his
                health, and also frustrated by his disorganization. Finally, he agrees to hire an
                assistant, begin working with a therapist, and learn more about management. Mortenson, meanwhile, keeps looking for a rich patron and repeatedly runs into odd
                people promising him checks but who obviously have no intention of giving him money. To learn more about developing poor areas, Mortenson visits the Bangladesh Rural
                Reconstruction Association, where he recognizes the importance of educating girls in
                a community and gains new energy for his mission. He stops briefly in Calcutta just
                after the death of Mother Teresa, whom he has admired since childhood, and sits with
                her body. Although he is temporarily revitalized, when he returns home he is

                are starving to death after fleeing the Taliban. Tara gives birth to their second

dusts him off, and places him down next to the White Queen. The
White King lies on his back, stunned in surprise, which causes Alice
to realize that she is invisible to the chessmen. Once the White
King recovers, he pulls out a pencil and begins jotting his experience

In their restful ease, the Eloi have grown weak, while the Morlocks have grown strong.

while a friend who has joined them for dinner attempts to calm Bridget down 
with words and wine. When Allworthy returns, silent and upset, Bridget wails and 
laments that someone must have murdered her husband. Suddenly a servant bursts 
in, crying that the Captain has been found. Two servants carry in his dead body, 
and Allworthy weeps at the sight, while Bridget screams and faints. Two doctors 
Dr. Y. and Dr. Z., arrive and debate the cause of death. Each doctor has a 
favorite disease that he invokes for every autopsy. Although Captain Blifil is 
now confirmed to be dead, Dr. Y and Dr. Z need to invent an excuse to stay 
longer so they will receive more money. Bridget remains bed-ridden for a month 
and Allworthy generously commissions an epitaph for the Captain's grave.",Shot by a rival,Apoplexy,Drowned,Cancer,1
17111,1 of 5 Chief among teenage Tom's faults is his passion for ___.,"Tom Jones, is introduced with an unfortunate anecdote. Tom possesses many 
faults, chief among them being his passion for stealing. Tom has recently stolen 
fruit from an orchard, a farmer's duck, and a ball from the pocket of Master 
Blifil, the son of the late Captain Blifil. Master Blifil abounds in ""Virtues"" 
and is praised by the neighborhood whereas Tom is despised. Blifil's virtues, in 
a nutshell, are sobriety, discretion, and piety.",Women,Stealing,Alcohol,Danger,1
17112,2 of 5 What does Square see virtue as?,"Mr. Square, who has been living some time with Allworthy, is introduced. Although not naturally intelligent, Square has improved himself through 
education, and is well-read in the ancient philosophers. Square believes that a 
man should always be a speculator and sees virtue as a ""Matter of Theory."" Square and  Thwackum are always arguing, and their only similarity is that 
neither will ever refer to the concept of ""Goodness"" in arguments. Square 
maintains that human nature is inherently virtuous, while Thwackum believes in 
original sin. Over dinner at Allworthy's table, Square and Thwackum debate 
whether honor can exist independent of religion. Their voices rise in volume and 
anger until something interrupts their debate. The narrator tells us we will 
have to wait until the next chapter to find out the nature of the interruption.",A matter of theory,A matter of duty,A matter of faith,A matter of convenience,0
17113,"3 of 5 What does Blifil call Tom, which earns Blifil a bloody nose?","Blifil has won over Square and Thwackum by always agreeing with their doctrines, 
which means that he has to keep silent when they are together, since their 
teachings always clash. Blifil, young as he is, has also learnt the art of 
""second-hand flattery""—praising Square and Thwackum to Allworthy, who 
goodheartedly conveys all of Blifil's compliments back to the men. Thwackum was 
recommended to Allworthy by a friend, and although Allworthy perceives 
Thwackum's faults, he has faith that Square will balance them out. Square and 
Thwackum despise Tom, who, the narrator admits, is ""a thoughtless, giddy Youth, 
with little Sobriety in his Manners."" Allworthy, however, allows Tom to call him 
""father.""",A wild womanizer,A motherless devil,A horse thief,A beggarly bastard,3
17114,4 of 5 Who are both Square and Thwackum interested in romantically?,"Both Square and Thwackum are interested in Bridget. The narrator 
says that one may wonder why so many male visitors to Allworthy's house have 
been attracted to Bridget, who is neither beautiful nor young. He then 
elaborates that men ""have a Kind of natural Propensity to particular Females at 
the House of a Friend … when they are rich."" Both of the men have 
discovered that the easiest way to curry favor with Bridget is to show kindness 
to Blifil and contempt for Tom. Although Bridget flirts with both Square 
and Thwackum, all she truly desires is ""Flattery and Courtship,"" for she does 
not wish to remarry. Square notices, however, that Bridget has hardly anything 
to do with the upbringing of her son, and harbors animosity towards Blifil 
because of the bitter memory of his father. On the other hand, she thrives on 
carrying out Allworthy's plans for Tom's well-being. The neighbors attribute 
Bridget's devotion to Tom to her obedience to her brother, but the narrator 
suggests that the maturing Tom has become attractive to women. Once the 
neighbors realize that Bridget is smitten with Tom, they call him a ""rival"" to 
Square and Thwackum. Bridget now revels in Tom's company.",Mrs. Western,Jenny Jones,Bridget,Sophia,2

sale, Thwackum prepares to beat him. Allworthy walks in and questions Tom in 
private. Tom calls Thwackum a ""tyrannical Rascal,"" and Allworthy cautions him 
against using such language. Tom tells Allworthy he gave all the money from the 
horse to Black George and his family, who have been living in poverty since 
Allworthy dismissed them. Allworthy sheds some tears in appreciation of Tom's 
compassion.",Gives it to Black George,Gambles it away,Pays Allworthy’s debts,Spends it on women,0

apart. The narrator, however, does not want this history to be the kind that is 
so boring it cannot be digested without a bout of ale. Since the heroine is to 
be presented in the following chapter, the narrator traces literary examples of 
hero introductions. He praises the tragic poets, who knew best how to welcome 
their heroes (with a resounding of drums) and their lovers (with gentle 
melodies). He self-consciously states: ""Our Intention, in short, is to introduce 
our Heroine with the utmost Solemnity in our Power, with an Elevation of Stile, 
and all other Circumstances proper to raise the Veneration of our Reader.""",Romance,Action,Truth,Innocence,2

with her. The narrator speculates that this may stem from idiocy, or from bad 
taste, but the truth is that Tom is in love with another woman. The narrator 
imagines that the reader will be indignant that he has heard nothing of this 
girl, who is in fact the second eldest of the five children of Black George. Molly Seagrim, one of the country's best-looking girls, has transfixed Tom's 
attentions to the point where his inclinations are to try and force himself upon 
her. Tom's morals, however, prevent him from doing so.",Sixteen,Eighteen,Twenty,Twenty-two,1

Tom soon puts her beating heart to rest with his plea for Black George. Tom says 
that if Squire Western takes action against Black George, it will be surely be 
the death of him and his family. Sophia, having recovered her composure, smiles 
and says that this is not a big favor to ask. Indeed, the previous day she 
herself sent a ""small Matter"" to Black George's wife. The narrator informs us 
that this ""small Matter"" was in fact one of Sophia's own gowns, linen, and ten 
shillings. Tom had heard of Sophia's generosity, which encouraged him to ask for 
her assistance. Tom begs Sophia to urge her father to find employment for Black 
George. Sophia promises to try her best if Tom will return a favor. After 
exclaiming ""I would sacrifice my Life to oblige you,"" Tom kisses Sophia's hand. This is the first time Tom's lips have ever touched Sophia's body, and she now 
feels ""a Sensation to which she had been before a Stranger."" Once Sophia regains

father of Molly's child. Sophia does not want to hear about it, and sends Mrs. 
Honour to see whether Sophia has to attend to her father at breakfast. The 
narrator reminds us of Sophia's burgeoning love for Tom, which has now 
overwhelmed her. Sophia decides that the only cure for her lovesickness is to 
avoid Tom by making a visit to her aunt. However, an accident will prevent 
her from leaving.",Squire Western,Thwackum,Captain Blifil,Black George,3

Black George to tell him she would like to hire Molly as her maid servant. Black George is secretly shocked that Sophia has not noticed that Molly is 
pregnant. He heads home for advice from his wife, but the family is in an uproar 
over what happened at church, when the women assaulted Molly with ""Dirt and 
Rubbish."" In retaliation, Molly knocked out the leader of the pack and cleared 
herself a path using a skull and thighbone from the graveyard as her weapons. The narrator tells the story in an ironic Virgilian style, 
listing the names of the men and women who fell victim to Molly. Goody Brown 
is the only woman to fight back. She attacks Molly and tears out her hair. The 
narrator observes that since women never fail to aim for each other's breasts 
when fighting, Goody Brown, who is flat-chested, has the upper hand. Tom's 
arrival quells the fight.",Human bones,A stack of bibles,Her boots,Two bricks,0

wheedling, Honour reveals that Sophia will not buy a new muff, but holds on to 
the one that Tom had kissed earlier. Squire Western enters to summon Tom to 
the harpsichord, where Sophia sits, wearing her muff and looking lovelier than

overlook the fact that Sophia eclipses Molly in both appearance and character. Tom hopes that maybe he can apologize to Molly by offering her money, since her 
desperation might be greater than her love for him. One day, with his broken arm 
in a sling, Tom goes to visit Molly. Tom finds the upstairs door locked, and 
Molly eventually appears and tells Tom she has been sleeping. Tom tells Molly 
that Allworthy would be furious if he knew they were together, and says he wants

it like a ""Man."" Blifil assures his tutors that he would not be able to survive 
if he did not have their sound lessons to fall back on. They debate whether or

17217,2 of 5 Whose relationship with Danny takes on a wonderful coolness once Danny’s rental house burns down?,"One suspicion that readers might jump to when they encounter the paisanos of Monterey is that they live the way they do because of lack of possessions. If this were true, then there would be nothing worth examining about their lifestyle because they themselves would abandon it if they could. Danny proves that this is not true, and that there is something more enduring than possession or lack of it in the paisano world. The conventional anger at the loss of his house is quickly replaced by an understanding of the worthlessness of transient things like houses when compared to spiritual things like friends. He then reaches an even more mature plateau; he feels secretly glad to be free of the burden of the house. Possession creates a sort of commitment, which creates a responsibility, which creates a cramp in the freedom that a paisano cherishes more than anything else. Owning two houses was too much for Danny. It is evident that he had already started to change because he had asked Pilon for the rent on his second house, something that the true Danny would never have wanted to do. With the second house out of the way and his position in life reduced from wealthy back to comfortable, where he wanted to be, Danny is able to live normally for a while, but in the end even the commitment represented by one house proves to be too much for Danny.",Mrs. Morales’,Pilon’s,Mrs. Torrelli’s,Tito Ralph’s,0
17218,3 of 5 What does the Pirate sell every day?,"In Monterey, there was a character that was known only as the Pirate. Every morning, the Pirate chopped a wheelbarrow full of pitch wood, which he sold as firewood. When the wood was sold, the Pirate would visit the back doors of four or five restaurants, from which he received packages of leftover food for his dogs. He had five dogs, whose names were Pajarito, Rudolph, Enrique, Fluff, and Senor Alec Thompson. Every night, the Pirate retired to an abandoned, cramped chicken house with his dogs. The dogs were the Pirates best friends; they kept him warm at night and they alerted him to any incoming danger. Whereas the Pirate's body was quite large and developed, his mind was not. His mind was still like that of a child's, so he often avoided talking to people. Most people knew at least a little about the pirate from seeing him with his load of wood, but Pilon knew everything about him.",Salvage,Newspapers,Food scraps,Firewood,3

Jesus Maria, in his kindness, comes up with a solution, to invite the Pirate into their house. They do this, and the Pirate is overjoyed. They enjoy wine and conversation, and though the Pirate does not offer much to their talks, he enjoys the time immensely. Every day, the friends try to pressure the Pirate to turn over his secret, but he never does. They even follow him into the woods on two occasions, but the Pirate always manages to lose them. Finally, one day the friends return from looking for the treasure to find the Pirate back at the house with a smile on his face. He had realized that he was followed the last two nights and had brought the money back to the house for safekeeping. In his bag was almost $200, which he had promised to spend on a gold candlestick for San Francisco, whom the Pirate believed had saved one of his dogs. The Pirate was very pleased to have trusted his friends.",Enrique,Portagee,Fluff,Senor Alec Thompson,1

Pilon did the math, and realized that the Pirate must have accumulated at least $100 over his years of work, and therefore must be hiding it in the woods somewhere. Pilon felt bad for the pirate, but at once realized the opportunity to benefit from the situation. The pirate must not understand the value of money, Pilon surmises, for he has no warm cloths or good food to eat. Pilon wants the Pirate to have those things, but having no money of his own, he cannot give them to him. However, if he were to offer the Pirate use of his mind, then it would be an act of merit.

Bob would ride in rodeos and volunteer himself to carry the flag in all of Monterey's parades, but everything that he did for attention would end up embarrassing him. He fell off of his horse early at the rodeo and at a parade; his horse had feinted and caused Bob to throw the flag so that it stuck in the ground like a spear. The laugher of the town at his mishaps pained Bob so greatly that he decided to fake an attempt at suicide to make them stop. His plan had been to wait for a friend to come and visit, and when they came in, he would put a gun to his head as if the friend had arrived just as he was about to pull the trigger. After waiting a long time for a friend to come at all, Charlie Meeler walked in the door. Instead of shouting for Bob to stop, Charlie drove at Bob to try and stop him, and in the process, the gun went off and Bob's nose was shot off.

Petey thought to himself that if he could get the girl to marry him in church he could make a decent woman of her, but at his proposal, the girl just laughed even more. Petey was so depressed that he went home and tried to hang himself, but his father walked in and saved him. Seeing the pain that she had caused, Gracy consented to marry Petey and she made a good wife after all. Now, Petey's father had loved Petey and done everything with him all through his young life. In the loneliness caused by Petey's absence, he sought comfort in Gracy's sister, Tonia, who was even more beautiful than Gracy. He fell in love with her, but the older sister was even worse that Gracy had been. The older Ravanno decided that if he faked suicide, maybe the girl would see what she was doing as well, and so he set an elaborate plan to hang himself and be found.

The author speculates that the circumstances in which a child is conceived profoundly influence its eventual mind, body, and character. He laments his parents' careless demeanor at this decisive juncture: ""had they duly consider'd how much depended on what they were then doing...I am verily persuaded I should have made a quite different figure in the world."" As it stands, he blames his own ""thousand weaknesses both of body and mind"" on their negligence. Tristram reveals that the whole circumstance of his coming into the world occurred as a series of such accidents and misfortunes. Stating succinctly that he was born on November 5, 1718, he promises to give the full details of his birth eventually, but only after a detour through his ""opinions.""

17342,"2 of 5 Aside from Yorick in Hamlet, who does Tristram compare Parson Yorick to?","Meandering through the history of the town midwife, Tristram takes the opportunity to satirize the obscure legal language of her license document. He also introduces the character of Parson Yorick, whom he relates to the jester Yorick in Hamlet and to Cervantes's Don Quixote. At the suggestion of his wife, Parson Yorick sponsors the training of the midwife as a service to the town. The parson actually stands to benefit personally from this benevolent gesture, since the townspeople were frequently borrowing his fine horses to ride the seven miles to the nearest doctor. In order to secure himself against charges of ulterior motives, he has vowed always to ride the decrepit old horse on which we now see him. Yorick's constant joking and acid wit make him many enemies; his unpopularity eventually drives him to a miserable early death.",Moses,Don Quixote,Prospero,Dr. Faustus,1
17343,3 of 5 What is the term Tristram uses for the narrow and often esoteric pursuits that interest people?,"The transition from the satire of legal language to the story of Yorick and his horses takes place by means of a brief, essayistic account of ""hobby-horses"": the narrow and often esoteric pursuits (hobbies, essentially) that interest people--often, to the point of obsession. The stories of Yorick and the midwife are also interrupted by the Dedication in Chapter 8, and by a passage in which Tristram forecasts his own literary fame.

17344,4 of 5 Where does Mrs. Shandy want to give birth?,"The marriage settlement between Tristram's parents stipulates that Mrs. Shandy could choose to bear her children in London, where she would find superior medical care. It also states, however, that if she made the trip to London on any false alarms, the husband could require her to stay in the country on the next occasion. This is the clause Walter Shandy invokes at the time of Tristram's birth. While Tristram thinks the legal arrangement, on the whole, a fair one, he thinks it ""hard that the whole weight of the article should have fallen entirely, as it did, upon myself."" He chalks this up as another one of his misfortunes, since it led him to be born with a flattened nose (the explanation about how this came to pass is deferred). Mrs. Shandy, since she cannot have ""the famous Dr. Maningham"" of London, insists on employing the midwife to deliver the baby--out of peevishness, Tristram suggests.

The narrator declares that he cannot yet tell the story of how he came to be called Tristram, appealing to the necessity that ""I should be born before I [am] christened.""

Speculating about Mrs. Shandy's preference for the midwife, Toby suggests that it might be a question of modesty. Walter challenges him on this point, and Toby defers, admitting that he knows nothing about women. He alludes to the unfortunate outcome of his affair with Widow Wadman as evidence of the fact.

He first claims that it has been an hour and a half since Obadiah left on his errand--plenty of time to return with the doctor. He then argues, from the other side, that no more than two minutes, thirteen and three-fifths seconds could possibly have passed. Finally, he offers the conjecture that years have passed, since all the stories of Uncle Toby's military career and invalidism have intervened since the birthday was first mentioned.

With strength in numbers, the medical hobby-horses of Walter and Dr. Slop outpace Uncle Toby's militaristic reflections, and the latter is unable to regain the floor.

Tristram criticizes his father for not pausing to switch hands, but Walter has never been one to retract a decision once he has advanced it.

Obadiah knotted it up to prevent it from clattering during transport so that he could hear himself whistle. Tristram suggests that this knot, too, contributed to the flattening of his nose. Dr. Slop cuts his thumb with a penknife. He falls to cursing Obadiah, and Walter offers him the use of one of his ready-made curses. The curse he produces is actually a Catholic excommunication document, written by Ernulphus the Bishop. Dr. Slop hesitates at its vehemence, but then is persuaded to continue with the excommunication, inserting Obadiah's name wherever relevant.

drifts in and out of dreams, most of which revolve around the workings
of Tellson’s bank. Still, there exists “another current of impression
that never cease[s] to run” through Lorry’s mind—the notion that
he makes his way to dig someone out of a grave. He imagines repetitive conversations
with a specter, who tells Lorry that his body has lain buried nearly
eighteen years. Lorry informs his imaginary companion that he now
has been “recalled to life” and asks him if he cares to live. He
also asks, cryptically, “Shall I show her to you? Will you come
and see her?” The ghost’s reaction to this question varies, as he sometimes
claims that he would die were he to see this woman too soon; at
other times, he weeps and pleads to see her immediately.",In England and the United States,In France and the United States,In the United States only,In England and France,3

testimony supports the Attorney-General’s case. The cross-examination,
however, tarnishes Barsad’s pure and righteous character. It reveals
that he has served time in debtor’s prison and has been involved
in brawls over gambling. The prosecution calls its next witness,
Roger Cly, whom the defense attorney, Mr. Stryver, also exposes
as a dubious, untrustworthy witness. Mr. Lorry then takes the stand,
and the prosecution asks him if, five years ago, he shared a Dover
mail coach with the accused. Lorry contends that his fellow passengers
sat so bundled up that their identities remained hidden. The prosecutors
then ask similar questions of Lucie, the young woman Darnay had
noticed earlier. She admits to meeting the prisoner on the ship
back to England. When she recounts how he helped her to care for
her sick father, however, she seems to help his case—yet she then
inadvertently turns the court against Darnay by reporting his statement
that George Washington’s fame might one day match that of George

fear they are trapped until Frodo remembers Sting, his Elf-made
knife. They cut their way through, and the hobbits are within view
of the exit from the tunnel. Frodo shouts that they should run and
pulls ahead. Sam lifts the phial to see, notices that there are
orcs ahead, though, and hides the phial. Suddenly Shelob attacks,
moving swiftly between Sam and Frodo. Sam shouts a warning to his
master, but he is silenced by the clammy hand of Gollum, who has
betrayed the hobbits by leading them to Shelob. Sam removes himself

the Ring from Frodo’s body and carrying it himself, remembering
that it was originally entrusted only to Frodo. But Sam decides
that, as Frodo’s companion, he may legitimately inherit the mission. Sam takes the Ring. He attempts to flee, but hears Orc voices surrounding
him. Without reflecting on his actions, Sam puts on the Ring, and

17585,"5 of 5 In an appendix to the book, whose behavior does Herman Melville argue in support of?","The Appendix offers a brief justification of the behavior of Lord George Paulet in the Sandwich Islands, also known as the Hawaiian Islands. Paulet's behavior had been widely criticized in America, so Melville wants to justify what he did. He explains that Paulet came to Hawaii in response to a claim that there had been abuse against resident British citizens there. The local monarchy refused to meet with him. As Paulet wandered the streets and spoke with common natives, he found widespread dissatisfaction at the overly restrictive monarchy. The Hawaiian leaders had apparently aligned themselves closely with Methodist missionaries, thereby making many natural activities illegal, such as non- marital sexual intercourse. These new laws resulted in the widespread incarceration of young girls. Additionally, many of the Hawaiian leaders were hypocritical as they actually benefited financially from the presentation of young girls to arriving European men. In response to this state of affairs, Lord Paulet took over governing the island. For the length of his annexation (about ten days), the common people rejoiced in their ability to act as they always had. Wild revelry and debauchery took place on the streets in broad daylight. Melville therefore argues that Lord Paulet actually helped the Hawaiians by freeing them from the rhetoric of the missionaries, even though public opinion has not agreed.",Lord George Paulet,King Kamehameha III,Gerrit P.

Tommo feels slightly jealous that Marnoo is getting the attention usually given to him. Tommo cannot understand much of what Marnoo says, but after a while Marnoo turns and addresses him in English. Marnoo has ""taboo"" status on the island, which means he can travel through the different tribal sections without being accosted. As a boy, a ship captain took him to Australia where he learned English. Tommo starts asking Marnoo about Toby and the possibility of escape. Mehevi and the other chiefs soon enter the hut, though, and become angered at Marnoo and Tommo's interaction, since they know it relates to Tommo's leaving the valley. Marnoo stops talking to Tommo and, soon after, he leaves, much to Tommo's disappointment.",Australia,England,America,Scotland,0
17606,"1 of 5 What does Tommo make for the people of the tribe, which provides excitement for nearly ten days?","In order to best describe Typee life, the narrator profiles a typical day. Usually, they wake late, after the sun is up. Then they rise and bathe in a nearby refreshing stream. A light breakfast is enjoyed and then pipes are smoked. After breakfast, people tend to whatever they like. Tinor inspects her cloth and food supplies; Marheyo works on his hut; the girls adorn their hair and skin with oils. The narrator usually wanders with Kory-Kory or else sits inside. Then they enjoy a midday nap. Usually in the afternoon, the narrator goes to the Ti, where Mehevi and the other chiefs gather. Since women are not allowed in the Ti, it resembles a happy bachelor pad where the best food can be found and where the men sit around smoking and talking. After night falls, a light evening meal of ""poee-poee,"" cooked breadfruit, is eaten. Native girls often dance around their huts under the moonlight. Everyone then sleeps.

One day, Tommo senses great commotion around the Ti and learns that a large festival will take place on the following day. Pigs are being caught to be roasted and many calabashes of poee-poee are being prepared. After asking for the meaning of the festival, Kory-Kory takes him to the Taboo grove and points out a large pyramidal structure that has been made of calabashes and empty coconut shells. Tommo still does not understand the meaning of the festival, but he decides to call it the ""Feast of the Calabashes.""",Feast of the Breadfruit,Feast of the Calabashes,Feast of the Kamani,Feast of the Coconuts,1

Kolory then takes the idol of Mon Artu and whispers into his ear. Mon Artu does not seem to hear him, but Kolory then places him in a wooden box face down on the ground. Mehevi and the chiefs all applaud. When Kolory takes Mon Artu out of the box and talks to it again, the idol now seems to be able to talk back.

Women wear their hair long and frequently adorn it with oils, as they do their skin. They wear simple Polynesian clothing, except for, on a few occasions, when some European calicos are seen. The Typees all seem to be in the same social class, with the exception of the chiefs. When a chief gives an order, it is obeyed promptly, yet still the chiefs do not live on a highly elevated plane as many other monarchies, both European and native (such as Hawaiian) demand.

The Typees seem to govern themselves according to common-sense law, almost like an honor code. The narrator never sees a single quarrel during his whole stay in the valley. He thinks that people might get along well because they attach little importance to the idea of ownership. Although some families have larger huts than others (or more calabashes), no one ever tries to purchase land, or to buy a banana tree, as Europeans would. Another striking quality is the general unanimity of most ideas. People rarely argue, it seems, because they always agree with one another. The Typees do not have a culture that hinges on ideological debate. Their social climate is peaceful and always agreeable. With such gentility, it is amazing, the narrator thinks, that Europeans believe these natives to be savages.",Never sees a quarrel,Is forbidden from tribunals,Avoids argumentative tribe members,Can’t read their legal texts,0

When the fishermen return with their catch, the fish are systematically doled out to the entire community with according to their family size. One night around midnight, the narrator is sleeping when Marheyo wakes him to say that the fish have come. Marheyo heads to Ti to claim his distribution. When he gets back, everyone in the house is roused. A fire is made and other food dishes are prepared. The fish are then eaten, in accordance with the local style—in their entirety, and raw.

He gets up and gestures for the narrator to come sit down and be tattooed. Under no circumstances does the narrator want to be tattooed. When Kory-Kory joins forces to get the narrator onto the bench for a tattoo, the narrator physically shoves them out of the way and runs from the hut. Karky and Kory-Kory follow him, but eventually Karky leaves him alone. Sometime later, Chief Mehevi says that Tommo needs to get tattooed. Despite the narrator's extreme distress at the thought of a tattoo, when the subject keeps coming up, he proposes a tattoo to his arms.

The men quickly rewrap the packet and Kory-Kory starts promptly offering excuses. Tommo knows what he saw however.

owl has been with him the whole time, he loses his fear. He fears
that the river will be stained with blood forever. He thinks about
the town, which he knows his father despises, and the llano, and
he wonders why Lupito had to die. He remembers when his father built
their house. Rather than choosing to build on a patch of fertile
ground, Gabriel built a house on a barren place at the start of the
llano. Antonio enters the house and Ultima meets him. She cleans
him and puts him to bed. Ultima explains that it is not for them

people disobeyed the rule. One god pleaded for mercy, so the gods
turned the people into carp instead of killing them. The
god who saved the people grew sad, so he became a carp as well. However, he is larger than the other carp and golden in color. The

died when he was three, and his father slowly killed himself with

why God would do such things to him. Antonio cannot answer because
these are the very questions that haunt Antonio himself. When Antonio
and Florence are late to catechism lessons, Father Byrnes punishes
Florence but not Antonio. Florence stands patiently in the aisle,
holding his arms out to his side, while Bones quietly vandalizes
a pew near the oblivious Father Byrnes. Father Byrnes tells a frightening
story to explain how long eternity is. He tells the children to
imagine that they must move a huge pile of sand across the ocean
by allowing a little bird to move one grain of sand at a time. When

bed and thinks back over their frequent moves, a result of Bloom’s
shaky financial history. Molly worries that he has spent money on
a woman today, as well as the Dignam family. Molly thinks of the
men at Dignam’s funeral—they are nice, but Molly resents their condescension
to Bloom. Molly recalls Simon Dedalus’s vocal talent and wonders
about Simon’s son. Molly remembers meeting Stephen as a child and
fantasizes that Stephen is probably not stuck-up, just young enough,
and appealingly clean. Molly plans to read and study before he comes
again so he will not think her stupid.",Bloom,Stephen,Boylan,Mulligan,1
17730,5 of 5 The novel ends with Molly fondly remembering ___.,"In her sixth sentence, Molly’s mind wanders from her
Gibraltar girlhood to Milly. Molly does not like being alone in
the house at night now—it was Bloom’s idea to send Milly to Mullingar
to learn photography, because he sensed Molly and Boylan’s impending affair. Molly ponders her close but tense relationship with Milly, who has
become wild and good-looking like Molly used to be. Molly realizes
with frustration that her period is starting and gets up to use
the chamberpot. She realizes that Boylan did not make her pregnant. Scenes from the afternoon run through her mind.",Her first kiss,Her musical training,Her afternoon affair,Her marriage proposal,3
17731,1 of 5 Stephen is teaching a class on which Greek figure?,"Stephen is teaching a history class on Pyrrhus’s victory—the
class is not very disciplined. He drills the students, and a boy
named Armstrong phonetically guesses that Pyrrhus was “a pier.” Stephen indulges him and expands on Armstrong’s answer, calling
a pier “a disappointed bridge.” He imagines himself subserviently
dropping this witticism later for Haines’s amusement. Thinking of
Phyrrus’s and Caesar’s murders, Stephen wonders about the philosophical inevitability
of certain historical events—is history the fulfillment of the only
possible course of events, or one of many?",Xenophon,Demosthenes,Lysicles,Pyrrhus,3
17732,2 of 5 Stephen tells his students about a fox burying ___ under a bush.,"Stephen takes the class through Milton’s Lycidas as
he continues to ponder his own questions about history, questions
he thought about while reading Aristotle in a Paris library. An
image from Milton’s poem makes Stephen think of God’s effect on
all men. Stephen thinks of the lines of a common riddle then decides
to tell the students his own riddle as they gather their things
and prepare to leave to play field hockey. Stephen alone laughs
at his impenetrable riddle about a fox burying his grandmother under
a bush.",A hedgehog,Gold coins,His grandmother,A bible,2

box. Deasy lectures Stephen on the satisfaction of money earned
and the importance of keeping money carefully and of saving it. Deasy remarks that an Englishman’s greatest pride is the ability
to claim he has paid his own way and owes nothing. Stephen mentally
tallies up his own abundant debts.",A Frenchman’s,An Englishman’s,A Scotsman’s,An Irishman’s,1
17734,4 of 5 Who does Deasy seem to blame for the corruption and destruction of national economies?,"Stephen hears shouts welcoming a goal scored on the hockey field. Deasy hands Stephen his completed letter and Stephen skims it. The
letter warns of the dangers of foot-and-mouth cattle disease and
suggests that it can be cured. It seems that Deasy resents the influence
of those people who currently have power over the situation. He
also seems to blame Jews for similar corruption and destruction
of national economies. Stephen argues that greedy merchants can
be Jewish or gentile, but Deasy insists that the Jews have sinned
against “the light.”",Jews,Industrialists,The Pope,Immigrants,0
17735,5 of 5 Stephen proposes that God is nothing more than a ___.,"Stephen remembers the Jewish merchants standing outside
the Paris stock exchange. Stephen again challenges Deasy, asking
who has not sinned against the light. Stephen rejects Deasy’s rendering
of the past, and states, “History is a nightmare from which I am
trying to awake.” Ironically, a goal is scored outside in the hockey
game as Deasy speaks of history as the movement toward the “goal”
of God’s manifestation. Stephen counters that God is no more than
“a shout in the street.” Deasy argues first that all have sinned,
then blames woman for bringing sin into the world. He lists women
of history who have caused destruction.",Childhood comfort,Shout in the street,Abusive father,Name for uncertainty,1
17736,"1 of 5 When Stephen notices Mrs. Florence MacCabe and another woman, what does he imagine one of them has in her bag?","Opening his eyes, Stephen notices two midwives, Mrs.
Florence MacCabe and another woman. Stephen imagines that one has
a miscarried fetus in her bag. He imagines an umbilical cord as
a telephone line running back through history through which he could place
a call to “Edenville.” Stephen pictures Eve’s navel-less stomach. He considers woman’s original sin, and then his own conception. Stephen contrasts his own conception with that of Christ. According
to the Nicene Creed, a part of the Catholic mass, Christ was “begotten,
not made,” meaning that he is part of the same essence as God the
Father and was not made by God the Father out of nothing. Stephen,
in contrast, was “made not begotten,” in that though he has biological
parents, his soul was created out of nothing and bears no relation
to his father’s. Stephen would like to argue the specifics of divine
conception (are the Father and the Son the same being or not?) with
heretic-scholars of the past.",A talking bird,A miscarried fetus,A wooden foot,A dog’s head,1

Virgin Mary’s insistence that her pregnancy was caused by a pigeon
(as recorded in Léo Taxil’s La Vie de Jesus). He
thinks of Patrice Egan, the son of Kevin Egan, a “wild goose” (Irish
nationalist in exile) whom Stephen knew in Paris. He remembers himself
in Paris as a medical student with little money. He remembers arriving once
at the post office too late to cash a money order from his mother. Stephen’s ambitions for his life in Paris were suddenly halted by
a telegram from his father, calling Stephen home to his mother’s
deathbed. He thinks back to Buck’s aunt’s insistence that Stephen
killed his mother by refusing to pray at her deathbed.",Husband,Cooking,Children,Housekeeping,0
17738,3 of 5 Stephen’s disgust for his family brings which writer to his mind?,"Coming out of his reverie, Stephen remembers feeling
ashamed of his family when he was a child. This disgust for his
family brings Jonathan Swift to mind—Swift’s disgust for the masses
is evidenced in his novel Gulliver’s Travels by
the noble Houyhnhnm horses and beastly Yahoo men. He thinks of Swift,
with a priestly tonsured head, climbing a pole to escape the masses. Stephen thinks of priests all around the city and of the piety and
intellectual pretensions of his youth.",W.B Yeats,Oscar Wilde,George Bernard Shaw,Jonathan Swift,3
17739,"4 of 5 While Stephen is sitting on a rock by the beach, he sees the carcass of a ___.","Stephen remembers the sights and sounds of Paris, and
of Kevin Egan’s conversations about nationalism, strange French
customs, and his Irish youth. Stephen walks to the edge of the sea
and back, scanning the horizon for the Martello tower. He again
vows not to sleep there tonight with Buck and Haines. He sits on
a rock and notices the carcass of a dog. A live dog runs across
the beach, back to two people. Stephen imagines the beach scene

night: a man holding a melon was leading Stephen on a red carpet. Watching the woman cocklepicker, Stephen is reminded of a past sexual encounter
in Fumbally’s lane. The couple pass Stephen, looking at his hat. Stephen constructs a poem in his head and jots it down on a scrap
torn from Deasy’s letter. Stephen wonders who the “she” of his poem
would be. He longs for affection. Stephen lies back and contemplates
his borrowed boots and small feet that once fit into a woman’s shoes. He pisses. He thinks again of the drowned man’s body. Stephen gets
up to leave, picks his nose, then looks over his shoulder to see
if anyone has seen. He sees a ship approaching.",Wine bottle,Mask,Melon,Scepter,2

woman across the street, McCoy makes small talk about Paddy Dignam’s death,
which he heard about from Bantam Lyons. Bloom anticipates seeing
the woman’s leg as she steps into her cab, but a tram blocks his

the letter back in his pocket. He will never agree to meet her,

watches the priest rinse out the wine chalice and wonders why they

of slavery. Although she never confronted his father directly, St.

being the master of a huge plantation and hundreds of slaves. St.
Clare tells of a slave who was caught trying to run from the plantation. He explains that the slave had a reputation for rebelliousness,

then made out free papers for the slave. But the slave felt so grateful

Romanticism is “to see everything, and to see often incomparably

Russian form of Romanticism is open-minded and practical, concerned
with the preservation of “the beautiful and lofty” but also with
an eye for self-preservation. The Russian Romantic does not seem
to let his Romanticism get in the way of his career: he “wouldn’t

She describes how a band of Confederates seized an engine in Atlanta and rode off with the Yankees in hot pursuit ""like a meeting between two iron knights of the old time, not for material gain but for principle—honor denied with honor, courage denied with courage—the deed done not for the end but for the sake of the doing…"" Bayard reflects that despite the war's devastation, he has never experienced the passion and excitement of the fighting itself, a passion he yearns for and which the locomotive chase symbolizes. After the others go to bed, Drusilla calls Bayard out onto the porch to see groups of slaves passing in the night. She tells him what a relief the war is for her—instead of having to settle down, get married and obey her husband, she can be independent free of domestic constraints. She asks Bayard to ask his father to let her join his regiment. In the morning the travelers set off again joined by Drusilla. As they approach the army their wagon is surrounded by a ""tide"" of black men and women yearning to join up with the Yankees and see the river that represents freedom to them. When they reach the riverbank, the wagon is lifted off the ground by the mass of people. In the chaos, Granny shouts at a Union officer that she wants her silver back, but he ignores her. A moment later, the soldiers blow up the bridge. Bayard is so confused by the mob scene that he barely notices when the bank caves and the wagon and the slaves fall in the water.

Ab Snopes, a local poor white who Colonel Sartoris has asked to look after Granny, has taken a batch of the mules to Memphis to sell to the Union army. We learn that Granny and Ab have developed an ongoing scam. Using the original protection order from Colonel Dick and some captured U.S. letterhead, Granny forges orders requisitioning mules. Her slaves burn off the U.S. brand on the mules, and Ab sells the mules back to the army for pure profit. Ab says that they have gained hundreds of mules and more than six thousand dollars so far. As always, Granny and Ab argue about the low price he has received. It is clear she does not fully trust him because she does not store the money under the floorboards for safekeeping until he is gone, but Ab tells Granny loudly and admiringly how much he respects her cunning and her bravado.",Escaping slaves,Yankee carpetbaggers,The US Army,The Confederate Army,2

The lieutenant is furious, but he says that he is on evacuation orders and has only come to retrieve U.S. property. The lieutenant gives Granny a voucher for the fence his men have destroyed. He is nervous, since he would be responsible for any debts incurred by a forgery that Granny might carry out. Granny assures him he need not worry.

Aschenbach takes out his traveling writing-case and begins to work but soon tosses it aside, not wanting to miss the diversions of the scene before him; eating some ripe strawberries from a passing vendor, he watches the boy play with the other children, one of whom, ""Jashu,"" seems his closest companion, his ""vassal and friend.""

Socrates says that the artist cannot pursue Beauty without Eros as a companion and guide; the longing of the artist's soul must be that of the lover; thus, Socrates declares that ""we writers"" cannot be prudent, cannot be grandly somber, but must necessarily fall into the ""abyss.""

17991,1 of 5 What was the intended goal of Thoreau’s stay at Walden Pond?,"Thoreau begins by matter-of-factly outlining his two-year
project at Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts (on land owned
by his spiritual mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, although Thoreau does

two months, and then moved back to “civilized society”—thus acknowledging
right away, and quite honestly, that this was not a permanent lifestyle
choice, but only an experiment in living. He describes the reactions
of people to news of his project, noting their concern for his well-being
out in the wilderness, their worry about his health in the winter,
their shock that anyone would willingly forsake human companionship,
and occasionally their envy. Thoreau moves quickly to the moral
of his experiment: to illustrate the benefits of a simplified lifestyle. He tells us he is recounting the rudimentary existence he led there
so that others might see the virtue of it. He argues that excess
possessions not only require excess labor to purchase them, but
also oppress us spiritually with worry and constraint. As people
suppose they need to own things, this need forces them to devote
all their time to labor, and the result is the loss of inner freedom. Thoreau asserts that, in their own way, farmers are chained to their
farms just as much as prisoners are chained in jails. Working more
than is necessary for subsistence shackles people. Faced with a
choice between increasing one’s means to acquire alleged necessities
and decreasing one’s needs, Thoreau believes minimizing one’s needs
is preferable by far. Thoreau identifies only four necessities:
food, shelter, clothing, and fuel. Since nature itself does much

to the woods, dreaming of an existence free of obligations and full
of leisure. He proudly announces that he resides far from the post
office and all the constraining social relationships the mail system

of leisure. He proudly announces that he resides far from the post
office and all the constraining social relationships the mail system
represents. Ironically, this renunciation of legal deeds provides
him with true ownership, paraphrasing a poet to the effect that
“I am monarch of all I survey.”",Goes fishing,Dips his toes,Bathes,Dives and resurfaces,0
18005,5 of 5 What term does Thoreau use for our internal means of measuring the reality of things?,"Thoreau’s delight in his new building project at Walden
is more than merely the pride of a first-time homeowner; it is a
grandly philosophic achievement in his mind, a symbol of his conquest
of being. When Thoreau first moves into his dwelling on Independence Day,
it gives him a proud sense of being a god on Olympus, even though
the house still lacks a chimney and plastering. He claims that a
paradise fit for gods is available everywhere, if one can perceive
it: “Olympus is but the outside of the earth every where.” Taking
an optimistic view, he declares that his poorly insulated walls
give his interior the benefit of fresh air on summer nights. He
justifies its lack of carved ornament by declaring that it is better
to carve “the very atmosphere” one thinks and feels in, in an artistry
of the soul. It is for him an almost immaterial, heavenly house,
“as far off as many a region viewed nightly by astronomers.” He
prefers to reside here, sitting on his own humble wooden chair,
than in some distant corner of the universe, “behind the constellation
of Cassiopeia’s Chair.” He is free from time as well as from matter,
announcing grandiosely that time is a river in which he goes fishing. He does not view himself as the slave of time; rather he makes it
seem as though he is choosing to participate in the flow of time
whenever and however he chooses, like a god living in eternity. He concludes on a sermonizing note, urging all of us to sludge through
our existence until we hit rock bottom and can gauge truth on what
he terms our “Realometer,” our means of measuring the reality of
things","Still, small voice",Conscience,True compass,Realometer,3

with book-learning, but should look around and “see” things in our
lives. But these things we are to “see” are not grand ideas; the

the Fitchburg Railroad, which passes near his home. His thoughts
turn to commerce. While he lauds the active resourcefulness, even
calling it “bravery,” of tradesmen, he fears that an excessive zeal
for business will ruin the wit and thoughtfulness of the nation. On Sundays Thoreau hears the bells of churches. At night he often
hears the owls, “midnight hags,” whose moans he interprets as “Oh-o-o-o
that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n!” He rejoices that owls
exist, for they can do their “idiotic and maniacal hooting” for
men, voicing the “unsatisfied thoughts which all have.” Thoreau
notes that even without a rooster or any other kept animals, his

is not alone in his solitude, since he is “suddenly sensible of
such sweet and beneficent society in Nature . . . as made the fancied
advantages of human neighborhood insignificant.” It is not that
he is giving up society, but rather that he is exchanging the “insignificant”
society of humans for the superior society of nature. He explains
that loneliness can occur even amid companions if one’s heart is
not open to them. Thoreau meditates on the deep pleasure he feels
in escaping the gossips of the town. Instead of their poisonous
company, he has the company of an old settler who lives nearby and
tells him mystical stories of “old time and new eternity,” and the
company of an old woman whose “memory runs back farther than mythology.” It is unclear whether these companions are real or imaginary. Thoreau

he says he has more visitors than he used to have when living in
town. And the overall quality of his socializing has improved as well. Because of his relative isolation, those visitors whom Thoreau does
receive are rarely on trivial errands, so that the less interesting ones
are “winnowed,” as he puts it, from the better ones. They make the
considerable journey from town only if they are deeply committed
to seeing him. He also meets an interesting collection of vagabonds
and wayfarers. Thoreau often finds admirable qualities in these
rude characters, and sees them as agreeable, deferential visitors. In contrast, Thoreau disdains beggars, remarking that “objects of
charity are not guests.” He entertains children on berry-picking expeditions. As an ardent abolitionist, he is also inclined to help runaway slaves
on the Underground Railway, though he does not boast about it.",Four stumps,A wooden bench,Three chairs,A porch swing,2

anyone else, and keeps three chairs ready for visitors. But he is
aware of the limitations of his small house, aware that “individuals,
like nations, must have suitable broad and natural boundaries.” Thus he often moves the conversation to the pine forest outside
his door. As a host he is not conventional. He is not concerned
with offering savory delicacies to his guests, and if there is not
enough food to go around, he and his guests go without. Caring more
about providing his visitors spiritual, rather than material, sustenance,
Thoreau proudly comments that he could nourish a thousand as easily
as twenty. If they go away hungry afterward, he says, at least they
have his sympathy.",He has plentiful crops,He rarely gets guests,He hunts extra food,He supplies spiritual sustenance,3

to focus not on the pleasures of rural life, but on its limitations, such
as the distance from town. Even when they claim to like walks in
the forest, Thoreau can see that they do not. Their lives are all taken

main centers of activity, the grocery, the bar, the post office,
and the bank. Stores of all kinds try to seduce him with their advertised
wares, but Thoreau has no interest in consumer splurges, and makes
his way back home without lingering too long in the marketplace. He often makes his way back to Walden Pond in the dark, which is
challenging. But with practice he grows accustomed to the way, feeling
his path out by the neighboring trees or the rut of the path below. Other people, he notes, are not as adapted to nighttime walking. Even in the village itself, he says, many lose their way in the
darkness, sometimes wandering for hours. Thoreau does not consider
such dislocation to be a bad thing. Through being lost, he says,
one truly comes to understand oneself and “the infinite extent of
our relations.”",Have a second breakfast,Drink a second coffee,Take his second nap,Take a second bath,3

of view and the time of day, the water of the pond may appear blue,
green, or totally transparent. It makes the body of the bather appear
pure white, rather than yellowish as the river water does. Thoreau reports
that Walden Pond is said by some to be bottomless. White stones
surround the shore, allowing Thoreau to venture a wry etymology

his more animalistic tendencies. It is never a fully successful
effort, yet even in failure he says it is a pursuit that yields
considerable rewards. As the animal nature fades, one approaches
divinity. Thoreau says we have a choice: we may strive to be either
chaste or sensual, either pure or impure. In the end, Thoreau says,
it is up to each individual to care for his or her body and his
or her soul, saying that “[e]very man is the builder of a temple.” The proof of that care will be evident in the face and in the features,
he says, which will acquire the visage of nobility when one engages
in right thought and action and the visage of degradation when one
engages in wrong thought and action. To conclude, Thoreau invokes
the figure of John Farmer, an allegorical representation of the
common man who hears the music of higher spheres, questions his
life of hopeless toil, and decides to live his life with a “new
austerity.” Farmer “redeem[s]” himself by letting his “mind descend

he sees that it is actually part of a large conflict pitting an
army of black ants against an army of red ants twice its number,
but whose soldiers are half the size of the black army. Thoreau
meditates on its resemblance to human wars, and concludes that the
ants are just as fierce and spirited as human soldiers. Thoreau
removes a wood chip, along with three ant combatants, from the scene
of the battle, carrying it back to his cabin to observe it. He places
them under a turned-over glass and brings a microscope to watch
their struggle. After witnessing a pair of decapitations and some
cannibalism, he releases the survivor.",Fall leaves,Crows,Ants,Snapping turtles,2

they prove quite comfortable in the woods, so inherently wild as
to spit at Thoreau when he comes too closely upon them. Thoreau
remembers one cat that was said to have had wings, perhaps resulting
from crossbreeding with a flying squirrel. Although he never sees
this cat, he was given a pair of her “wings” (pieces of matted fur
that she shed in the springtime), and says that as a poet, he fancies
owning a winged cat. Out on the pond in his boat, Thoreau at times
pursues the loon, hoping to get close enough for a long look. In
general, the loon allows him to advance to only a modest distance
before diving deep into the water, surfacing again with a loud laugh. Thoreau sees no rhyme or reason in this ritual, or in the movements
of the ducks, or in any of the motions that his other “brute neighbors”
go through. He concludes that they must be as enthralled by the
water and its natural surroundings as he is.",Rabbit,Mouse,Chipmunk,Cat,3

is dismayed by how nature’s bounty has been plundered for commercial
use. Still, there is enough left for him to feast on. The changing leaves
of autumn provide a brilliant spectacle, though Thoreau is well
aware that they herald the coming hardships of winter. Wasps flee
the colder weather in thousands, and Thoreau is forced to retreat
to his quarters. He goes to another side of the pond for a while
to soak in the remaining rays of the fall sun, which he prefers to
“artificial” fire. Toward the end of summer, Thoreau studies masonry
to build a chimney for his cabin with the help of his friend Channing. By November, Thoreau’s summer labors have proven a good investment,
as the fires keep him warm at night.",Mosquitos,Wasps,Horse flies,Ticks,1

regular encounters with a phoebe, a robin, and a partridge and her
brood; he calls these wild birds his hens and chickens. Less frequently
he sees otters and raccoons. Thoreau is struck by the raccoons’
ability to live hidden in the woods while nevertheless sustaining
themselves on the refuse of human neighborhoods. About a half-mile

Thoreau believes it had been settled more thickly earlier in the
century. Many of the earlier inhabitants had been blacks: Thoreau
summons up images of Cato Ingraham, the spinster Zilpha, Brister
Freeman and his wife, Fenda. Some of their abodes have almost completely
vanished, destroyed by age or fire. Thoreau recalls how Breed’s
hut burned to the ground in a fire twelve years before. Thoreau
and the local fire brigade had rushed out to save it, but had found
it too far gone. Thoreau recalls seeing the heir to the house lying
in shock, muttering to himself about the loss of his property. Near
Lincoln, a potter named Wyman had once squatted, followed by his
descendants. Another memorable recent inhabitant of the woods was
an Irishman named Hugh Quoil, formerly a soldier at the Battle of

Thoreau believes it had been settled more thickly earlier in the
century. Many of the earlier inhabitants had been blacks: Thoreau
summons up images of Cato Ingraham, the spinster Zilpha, Brister
Freeman and his wife, Fenda. Some of their abodes have almost completely
vanished, destroyed by age or fire. Thoreau recalls how Breed’s
hut burned to the ground in a fire twelve years before. Thoreau
and the local fire brigade had rushed out to save it, but had found
it too far gone. Thoreau recalls seeing the heir to the house lying
in shock, muttering to himself about the loss of his property. Near
Lincoln, a potter named Wyman had once squatted, followed by his
descendants. Another memorable recent inhabitant of the woods was
an Irishman named Hugh Quoil, formerly a soldier at the Battle of

White Pond. Again, the point of greatest depth is quite near to

Before dinner, they take a stroll along the ""Walk,"" a curved, windowed hallway that stretches the length of the main building. There are a fair number of people taking after-dinner strollsor enjoying the view, but nonetheless the Walk is not crowded. Burris mentions this to Frazier, who replies that crowds are extremely rare at Walden Two. In fact, they have been eliminated as much as possible. The only reason people enjoy crowds in the world at large is because they provide a false sense of community. At Walden Two, concerts and shows that appeal to the entire community are simply repeated in front of small audiences until everyone has had a chance to see them. Lectures, which are less likely to be repeated, are simply not worth giving; better to hand out a printed copy of the lecture to those who are interested.

Frazier replies that a great deal of time is wasted in the outside world: the second half of an eight-hour day is less productive than the first; people work less well when they are working for a boss than when they are working for themselves; many people who could work are unemployed; and many of the people who are working are doing so in capacities that aren't needed at Walden Two, such as banking, advertising, etc. Furthermore, women can do work that helps the community since their domestic duties are reduced or nonexistent. The members of Walden Two also consume less than members of the outside world. Castle agrees that Frazier has made his point. Frazier then surprises the group by telling them that, as guests, they are expected to contribute two labor credits for each day of their visit.

At Walden Two, this kind of shaping has been put to experimental test. Frazier and an early planner named Simmons studied classical ethics and modern psychology in order to design an environment in which children would grow up to be self-controlled, happy contributors to society. For example, in Walden Two, children at the age of three are given a lollipop to wear around their necks; the lollipop is coated with powdered sugar so that any lick of the tongue can be detected. The children are told that they can eat the whole lollipop later in the day if they have not licked it in the meantime.

They work in real laboratories, on real problems, and they can continue studying as long as they want. Castle argues that the children cannot possibly be motivated to learn as much as they would in a traditional school, but Frazer retorts that the traditional motives, such as fear of one's parents and the desire to dominate over other students, are hardly admirable.

his inability to cope with death’s inevitability and his inability
to live a meaningful life in the face of death. Murray notes that
Jack turned to Hitler to save himself from death, to lose himself
in Hitler’s power and aura, because “Hitler is larger than death.” As a purely intellectual argument, Murray says that one way of relieving
a fear of dying is to kill. According to Murray, the act of killing
rejuvenates the killer. He disagrees with Jack’s theory that “every
plot is a murder in effect.” For Murray, plots affirm life and advance
consciousness, and he believes that within every man lies a deep-seated
rage that he can potentially tap into to become a killer.",Finding the right drug,Finding God,Dying,Killing,3

describes their correspondence and tells Jack that Foster committed
the crime because he wanted to go down in history. Now, however,
Foster realizes that shooting a few random people in a tiny town
wasn’t enough to guarantee him fame, and if he could do it all again,
he would just assassinate one famous person. Jack comments that
he won’t go down in history, either, and Heinrich comments that
Jack, at least, has Hitler, while Tommy Roy Foster has nothing. Jack
and Heinrich discuss the fact that Heinrich’s mother wants him to
visit her that summer at the ashram where she lives. Jack asks Heinrich
if he wants to go, and Heinrich responds that he can’t tell. He
might want to go, but then that desire might just be the result
of a random misfiring neuron in his brain.",He hates humanity,He wanted fame,He is insane,He internalized extremist ideology,1

America. Later, when Steffie is distracted by a telemarketer’s phone
call, Jack tells Babette that Dana liked to plot and was often getting
him entangled in domestic and faculty battles. He remarks that she would

Dunlop sounds as if he were violating the laws of nature when he
speaks German. Jack tries to tease some personal information out
of the reticent Dunlop, who volunteers the information that he also
teaches Greek, Latin, sailing, and meteorology. Dunlop turned to
meteorology after his mother’s death and found the study of weather

his house when he returns from his lesson. Bob takes the three older
children out to dinner while Jack drives Babette to her tabloid-reading
appointment at Old Man Treadwell’s. A few minutes after dropping
her off, Babette comes back to the car and says Mr. Treadwell and
his elder sister are missing. They report the disappearance to the
police, then go to meet Bob and the kids at a donut shop. Jack sees
Babette look carefully and sympathetically at Bob, as if she were
trying to comprehend the four dramatic years they spent together.",Dr. Chakravarty,The Treadwells,Adele T.,Murray,1
18348,3 of 5 Where are the Treadwells found after four days missing?,"While Heinrich watches the proceedings at the river, word
comes that the Treadwells have been discovered at the local shopping
mall, where they’d been for four days. Two of those days were spent
huddled in a kiosk, while the sister foraged for scraps of food
from garbage cans. No one knows how the two of them got there or
why they didn’t call for help. Jack surmises that the Treadwells
were most likely overwhelmed by the vast strangeness of the mall
and overcome by their own helplessness.",The shopping mall,The river,The highway underpass,The old folks home,0

Stompanato, a forceful, charismatic, domineering man. Jack asks
Alfonse why people are fascinated by watching catastrophes on television. Alfonse says that it’s because people are bombarded by information
every day, and only catastrophes can break through that constant
flow of data. We crave catastrophes to get our attention, Murray
argues, as long as they happen somewhere else. He continues by saying
that people suffer from brain fade, and their senses have gotten
weary from misuse.",Dangerous stunt footage,Kennedy assassination footage,Watergate footage,Plane crash footage,3

past and current marriages. Tweedy expresses her unhappiness with
her inscrutable new husband, Malcolm, a diplomat who runs deep cover
operations in foreign countries. When Malcolm is working undercover,
Tweedy says, he doesn’t just disappear in the here and now. He disappears
so completely, it’s almost as if he never existed in the first place. Tweedy worries that she doesn’t truly know the man she married and
that maybe the part of his life spent undercover is more real to
him than the part of his life he spends with her. Jack tells Tweedy
that Janet Savory, Heinrich’s mom, lives at an ashram now and goes
by the name Mother Devi. Tweedy tries to wax nostalgic about her
and Jack’s marriage, but Jack thwarts her attempt.",Heinrich,Babette,Jack,Elvis,2
18352,2 of 5 What social phenomenon does Jack identify as a way in which people shield themselves from death?,"Jack attends Murray’s Elvis lecture. When he walks in,
Murray is making a point about the close relationship between Elvis
and his mother. Jack interjects that Hitler too adored his mother. Jack and Murray engage in a back-and-forth volley, trading anecdotes
about their respective cultural icons. Murray relates how Elvis
fell apart when his mother, Gladys, died, and Jack counters with
a description of the elaborate, expensive funeral Hitler held for
his mother, Klara. Alfonse Stompanato enters the room and settles
down to watch. Murray discusses Elvis’s death, particularly the
way the man had deteriorated into a haze of bloated, grotesque excess. Jack describes the surging crowds who gathered on the occasion of
Hitler’s death. He argues that the crowds gathered not so much to
honor Hitler, but simply to be a crowd. Losing one’s individual
identity in a crowd, Jack says, is a way of forming a shield against
death. After this extended passage, the lecture ends. Murray looks
at Jack thankfully, and Jack notices, as students gather around
him, that they have become a crowd. Jack says that, for once, he
doesn’t need a crowd around him, because, in the classroom, death
is strictly a professional matter. In the classroom, Jack is comfortable
with the concept of death.",Dating,Sports,Congo lines,Crowds,3

to the doctor, who tells them to give him an aspirin and put him
to bed. Jack proposes going to the emergency room, but Babette insists
on going to teach her posture class. While Babette is in class,
Jack waits in the car with Wilder. As he holds Wilder, Jack becomes
absorbed in the sound of the boy’s wailing. He seems to find something
ancient, eternal, and primal within the noise. As they drive home

go back to the airport. Before Bee’s flight arrives, passengers
from another flight come staggering into the airport. As a crowd
gathers, one of the passengers tells Jack the details of the near
crash they just survived. The plane had lost power in its engines
and began hurtling toward the ground. A voice over the intercom
shouted desperately that they were falling from the sky. That was
followed by another calmer voice, which explained that they had
not been prepared for this in flight school. The second voice narrated,
coolly and precisely, what would happen to the passengers upon impact. As people prepared for a crash landing, the plane suddenly regained
control. As the officers and flight attendants transitioned back
into their smooth corporate mode, everyone wondered why they had
ever been afraid in the first place. Jack finds Bee and Tweedy,
and Bee asks where the media had been during the plane crisis. Jack
tells her that Iron City has no media, and Bee responds with incredulity
that the passengers, then, must have gone through the ordeal for
nothing.",Hospitals,Media outlets,Insurance companies,Bars,1

obituaries he automatically compares the age of the deceased to

the entire family feel self-conscious. Bee is elegant, worldly,
and self-possessed, and Jack says that he admires her but also feels
threatened by her. On Christmas day, Jack and Bee have a conversation
about Bee’s mother, Tweedy. Bee tells Jack that Tweedy looks anxious
all the time and that she believes Tweedy’s agitation stems from
the persistent absences of her husband, Malcolm. Bee says Tweedy’s
real problem is that Tweedy doesn’t know who she is. As Bee talks,
comparing Tweedy to Babette, Jack gets the disturbing sensation
that Bee is attempting to communicate with him in some different,
mysterious way and that she’s trying to pry secret information from
him.",Dylar pills,Fashion tips,Information,Money,2

Jack that a train car has been derailed. Later, they both return
to watch the cloud. Heinrich says that the burning chemical in the
air is Nyodene Derivative, or Nyodene D., a toxic substance that
causes lumps in rats. The radio has already listed nausea, skin
irritation, and sweaty palms as potential symptoms of exposure. Jack tries to reassure Heinrich that the smoke won’t come toward
them and continues to act comfortable and indifferent. He sits down
to pay the bills, even as rumors of increasing danger come in over
the radio and phone. Sirens begin to blare through the neighborhood,
but Jack declares that such things can’t happen in a town like theirs. New symptoms are reported on the radio, and the cloud is given a
new name: the airborne toxic event. Heinrich tries to get his father
to acknowledge the danger, but Jack declares that he is a college

to an abandoned karate studio. Rumors of microorganisms capable
of eating the toxins in the clouds spread, and Jack acknowledges
that this sounds like something right out of a tabloid. Babette
notes that every new advance in technology makes her even more scared. A man holding a TV walks into the center of the room. He tells everyone
that there are no reports on what is happening and that the media

a nutrition class called Eating and Drinking. The world has gotten
