tell her his true feelings about Isabella. She offers to convince
Edgar to permit the marriage if Heathcliff truly loves the woman. Heathcliff scorns this idea, however, declaring that Catherine has
wronged him by marrying Edgar, and that he intends to exact revenge. Nelly informs Edgar of the encounter occurring between Catherine
and Heathcliff in the kitchen, and Edgar storms in and orders Heathcliff off
of his property. When Heathcliff refuses to leave, Edgar summons
his servants for help. However, Catherine locks herself and the two
men inside the kitchen and throws the key into the fire, forcing Edgar
to confront Heathcliff without the help of additional men. Overcome
with fear and shame, Edgar hides his face. Still, Catherine’s
taunts goad Edgar into striking Heathcliff a blow to the throat, after
which Edgar exits through the garden. In terror of the larger and stronger
Heathcliff, Edgar hurries to find help, and Heathcliff, deciding that
he cannot fight three armed servants, departs.",She finds it exciting.,She finds it filled with love.,She finds it boring.,She finds it miserable.,3
18586,1 of 5 What does Heathcliff say he will never forgive Catherine for?,"Four days after visiting Wuthering Heights, Nelly waits
for Edgar to leave for church, and then takes the opportunity to
give Heathcliff’s letter to the ailing Catherine. Catherine has
become so weak that she cannot even hold the letter, but nearly
as soon as Nelly tells her that it is from Heathcliff, Heathcliff
himself enters the room. Heathcliff and Catherine enter into a dramatic,
highly charged conversation during which Catherine claims that both
Heathcliff and Edgar have broken her heart. She says that she cannot
bear dying while Heathcliff remains alive, and that she never wants
to be apart from him. She begs his forgiveness. He says that he
can forgive her for the pain she has caused him, but that he can
never forgive her for the pain that she has caused herself—he adds
that she has killed herself through her behavior, and that he could
never forgive her murderer.",Breaking his heart,Marrying Edgar,Having Edgar’s baby,Causing herself pain,3

two months prematurely. She dies within two hours of giving birth. Nelly solemnly declares that her soul has gone home to God. When
Nelly goes to tell Heathcliff what has happened, he seems to know already. He curses Catherine for the pain she has caused him, and pleads
with her spirit to haunt him for the rest of his life. She may take
any form, he says, and even drive him mad—as long as she stays with
him. Edgar keeps a vigil over Catherine’s body. At night, Heathcliff
lurks in the garden outside. At one point, Edgar leaves, and Nelly permits
Heathcliff a moment alone with the body. Afterwards, Nelly finds
that he has opened the locket around her neck and replaced a lock of
Edgar’s hair with a lock of his own. Nelly twines Edgar’s lock around Heathcliff’s,
and leaves them both in the locket.",She runs away.,She dies.,She falls ill.,She asks for Heathcliff.,1

come, while Isabella is not invited at all. To the surprise of the
villagers, Catherine is not buried in the Linton tomb, nor by the
graves of her relatives. Instead, Edgar orders that she be buried
in a corner of the churchyard overlooking the moors that she so
loved. Nelly tells Lockwood that now, years later, Edgar lies buried
beside her.",In the Linton tomb,In the Earnshaw tomb,Overlooking the moors,At Thrushcross Grange,2

where she meets Hareton and takes an instant liking to him. She
and Hareton spend a delightful day playing near the crags. Nelly
arrives in pursuit of her charge, and tries to hurry her back to Thrushcross
Grange. But Catherine refuses to go. Nelly tells Catherine that
Hareton is not the son of the master of Wuthering Heights—a fact
that makes the girl contemptuous of him—but she also reveals that
he is Catherine’s cousin. Catherine tries to deny this possibility,
saying that her cousin is in London, that her father has gone to
retrieve him there. Nelly, however, explains that a person can have
more than one cousin. At last, Nelly prevails upon her to leave,
and Catherine agrees not to mention the incident to her father, who
might well terminate Nelly’s employment in rage if he knew she had
let Catherine learn of Wuthering Heights.",She likes him immediately.,She hates him.,She is disappointed by him.,She has a strong connection to him.,2

returns to Wuthering Heights to see to the funeral arrangements,
and to bring young Hareton back to Thrushcross Grange. She is shocked to
learn that Hindley died deeply in debt, and that Heathcliff, who had
lent Hindley large amounts of money to supply his gambling addiction,
now owns Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff does not allow Hareton
to return to Thrushcross Grange with Nelly, saying that he plans
to raise him on his own. He also intimates that he plans to recover his
son Linton at some point in the future. And so, Nelly tells Lockwood,
Hareton, who should have lived as the finest gentleman in the area,
is reduced to working for his keep at Wuthering Heights. A common,
uneducated servant, he remains friendless and without hope.",With respect,With nostalgia,With indifference,With hatred,3

worries over his daughter’s happiness, and over the future of his
estate. He says that if marrying Linton would make Catherine happy,
he would allow it, despite the fact that it would ensure that Heathcliff
would inherit Thrushcross Grange. Edgar’s health continues to fail,

meet Linton, not at Wuthering Heights, but on the moors, not realizing

less time with Catherine. Nelly attempts in vain to fill the companionship
role formerly played by the girl’s father. One winter day, during
a walk in the garden, Catherine climbs the wall and stretches for
some fruit on a tree. In the process, her hat falls off her head
and down to the other side of the wall. Nelly allows Catherine to
climb down the wall to retrieve it, but, once on the other side,
Catherine is unable to get back over the wall by herself. Nelly
looks for the key to the gate, and suddenly Heathcliff appears,
telling Catherine that it was cruel of her to break off her correspondence
with Linton. He accuses her of toying with his son’s affections,
and he urges her to visit Linton while he is away the following
week. He claims that Linton may be dying of a broken heart. Catherine
believes him and convinces Nelly to take her to Wuthering Heights
the next morning. Nelly assents in the hope that the sight of Linton
will expose Heathcliff’s lie.",Because she reminds him of her mother,Because she refuses to visit him,Because she broke his son’s heart,Because she does not treat Nelly well,2

behavior and quickly discovers where she has been spending her evenings. Catherine
tells Nelly the story of her visits to Wuthering Heights, including
one incident in which Hareton proves to her that he can read a name
inscribed above the manor’s entrance: it is his own name, carved
by a distant ancestor who shared it. But Catherine asks if he can
read the date—1500—and
he must confess that he cannot. Catherine calls him a dunce. Enraged,
Hareton interrupts her visit with Linton, bullying the weak young
man and forcing him to go upstairs. In a later moment of contrition,
he attempts to apologize for his behavior, but Catherine angrily
ignores him and goes home. When she returns to Wuthering Heights
a few days later, Linton blames her for his humiliation. She leaves,
but she returns two days later to tell him that she will never visit
him again. Distressed, Linton asks for her forgiveness. After she
has heard Catherine’s story, Nelly reveals the girl’s secret to
Edgar. Edgar immediately forbids her from visiting Linton again,

are out bird-hunting on the moors. Nelly loses sight of Catherine
for a moment, then finds her conversing with Heathcliff and Hareton. Catherine
says that she thinks she has met Hareton before and asks if Heathcliff
is his father. Heathcliff says no, but that he does have a son back
at the house. He invites Catherine and Nelly to pay a visit to Wuthering
Heights to see the boy. Nelly, always suspicious of Heathcliff,
disapproves of the idea, but Catherine, not realizing that this
son is her cousin Linton, is curious to meet the boy, and Nelly cannot
keep her from going. At Wuthering Heights, Heathcliff tells Nelly
that he hopes Catherine and his son will be married someday. For
their part, the cousins do not recognize one another—they have changed
much in three years—and because Linton is too sickly and self-pitying
to show Catherine around the farm, she leaves with Hareton instead,
all the while mocking the latter’s illiteracy and lack of education. Heathcliff forces Linton to go after them.",He will fall in love with Catherine.,He will die because of his illness.,He will become friends with Heathcliff.,He will become Hareton’s tutor.,0

This regiment would have the freedom to act as it chose. The other regiments would be officered with commoners chosen solely for their effectiveness and would bear the brunt of military duty. The king happily agrees. The Yankee hits on the idea of making the regiment up entirely of officers, the lower ranks filled by nobles who serve without pay and at their own expense, and the higher ranks filled by Arthur's many royal relatives, who would be paid a good salary and given an impressive title in return for renouncing their royal grants.",Nobles,Commoners,Foreigners,Slaves,0

loneliness and sense of meaninglessness, and must do so alone. As
a child, Didion had been fearful of the idea of meaninglessness
and found comfort in geology. The shifting and changing patterns
of the earth seemed inevitable and permanent, a notion Didion linked
to the Episcopal saying, “As it was in the beginning, is now and
ever shall be, world without end.” For Didion, the earth’s abiding
indifference was a comfort. While the destruction of human life
might cause personal sorrow, the world would always continue. After
she married and had a child, Didion found further comfort in domestic
routines, such as cooking meals and setting the table.",Frightened,So calm,Busy,Literally crazy,3

that she knew their deaths were inevitable and their passing didn’t
substantively affect her daily routines. In contrast, John’s death
is all-consuming. She refers to a study by psychologist Eric Lindemann
about the phenomenon of waves of grief. These waves begin for Didion when
she first returns, alone, to the apartment. Lynn Nesbit, the couple’s
longtime agent, comes over and calls the obituary writer for the New
York Times. Didion doesn’t know how to react, since an obituary
would be public proof that John has actually died. Didion reassures
Lynn that she will be fine spending the night alone, and she maintains
her composure until the following morning, when she awakes and cannot

the emergency workers will leave for the hospital without her, Didion
grabs her purse and John’s medical records. They leave for New York
Presbyterian Hospital, and when they arrive the gurney vanishes
into the building. A man approaches Didion and introduces himself
as her social worker. Looking back at that moment, Didion realizes
that that was precisely when she knew John was dead. She goes on
to describe how, in a state of denial, she had stood in lines and
followed procedures, thinking about how to get John transferred
to another hospital. When the doctor finally delivers official word
of his death, the social worker reassures the doctor that Didion
is a “pretty cool customer.” They take her to see the body and a
priest delivers last rites. After collecting John’s personal effects,

think of John as dead—and if they believe him to be dead, he might
never come back. She can’t give away his shoes, since she believes
that he will need them when he returns. Didion’s magical thinking

be able to fix the problem and bring him back to life.",Congee,Hummus,Cottage cheese,Cereal,0

at the photographs of the early years of her marriage that hang
in the hallway leading to her room. The pictures set off a series
of memories about a period in the early 1970s
when Didion had a close group of friends that frequently shared
dinners together. By the time of John’s death, several of those
friends are dead. Didion notes that people who have recently lost
someone have a certain look of vulnerability on their face. For
a while she feels invisible and incorporeal, wanting John back. Several years before John died, Didion was walking down West Fifty-seventh
Street in New York when she saw a strange burst of sunlight; at
the time, she thought it must have been an apprehension of death. In a dream some years before, she had seen an ice island, and in
the dream she knew the island symbolized death. Both images gave
her a sense of transcendence, rather than dread. Didion wonders
why she continues to see John’s death as something that has happened
to her, rather than to him. She
realizes that she is experiencing self-pity.",Recklessness,Vulnerability,Pride,Resentment,1

had buoyed his spirits, but in the fall his mood dropped again. She recalls a fight over a proposed trip to Paris, during which
he claimed that, if they did not go to Paris that November, he would
never see Paris again. They went, even though this declaration felt
like blackmail at the time. Shortly before John died, he claimed
that everything he had done was worthless, a sentiment Didion quickly
dismissed. The night of his death, John told her, “You were right
about Hawaii.” She wasn’t sure if he was referring to her suggestion
from earlier that morning, about renting a house in Hawaii where

going to do. Before the day is even half over, however, Father Tom
shows up at Rayona’s house. She tells Father Tom she is planning
to leave, and though he humors her at first, Rayona quickly recognizes
he will try to change her mind. She decides it will be easier if
she just goes to school. Father Tom invites her to an event called
the Teens for Christ Jamboree, and Rayona decides to go, if only
as a way of getting off of the reservation. The day they leave,
Father Tom brings Rayona by Aunt Ida’s house to pack. Aunt Ida is
not there, but Rayona can tell that Christine has stopped by recently
because a package that had arrived for Christine is gone, along
with some things from her room. Feeling even more rejected by her

jumps in. When she reaches the raft, Father Tom jumps in after her,

her close to him. They embrace, Father Tom “duck[s] his head,” and

Phoebe employs Silvius, who can talk so well of love, to help her pursue
Ganymede. Phoebe claims that she does not love Ganymede and wonders
why she failed to defend herself against such criticism. She determines
to write him “a very taunting letter,” and orders Silvius to deliver

Jaques for the extremity of his melancholy. When Jaques claims that
“’tis good to be sad and say nothing,” Rosalind compares such activity
to being “a post” (IV.i.8–9). Jaques defends himself, outlining for Rosalind the unique composition
of his sadness, but Rosalind gets the better of him and he departs.",His appearance,His home,His melancholy,His love,2

Rosalind and asks her to forgive his tardiness. Rosalind refuses,
insisting that a true lover could not bear to squander “a part of
the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love” (IV.i.40–41). She goes on to suggest that Orlando’s love is worse than a snail’s,
for though a snail comes slowly, he carries his house on his back. Eventually, though, Rosalind relents and invites Orlando to woo
her. The lesson begins: when he says that he desires to kiss her
before speaking, she suggests that he save his kiss for the moment
when conversation lags. What, Orlando worries, should he do if his
kiss is denied? Rosalind reassures him that a denied kiss would
only give him “new matter” to discuss with his lover (IV.i.69–70). When Rosalind refuses his affections, Orlando claims he will die. She responds that, despite the poet’s romantic imagination, no man

and marry them. Rosalind reminds Orlando that women often become
disagreeable after marriage, but Orlando does not believe this truism of
his love. He begs leave in order to dine with Duke Senior, promising
to return within two hours. Rosalind teasingly chastises him for parting
with her but warns him not to be a minute late in keeping his promise. After Orlando departs, Celia berates Rosalind for so badly characterizing

He asks his fellow businessmen to give Adriana an excuse for his tardiness and then mentions that his slave is behaving oddly. When he knocks at the gate, however, Dromio of Syracuse refuses to let the company in. Antipholus pounds and shouts furiously, bringing Luce, his maid to the door, and then Adriana--but since both believe that Antipholus is already inside, they refuse to admit him. In a rage, Antipholus is about to break down the door when Balthasar dissuades him, telling him that doing so will reflect badly on his wife's honor and that Adriana must have a good reason for keeping him out. Still seething, Antipholus leads his friends away, resolving to dine with a Courtesan at her house, the Porpentine.

Then, Antipholus S. tells his slave that he intends to depart from Ephesus immediately and sends him to the harbor to book passage.

ensure his revenge without creating any appearance of foul play. He recalls that Hamlet has been jealous in the past of Laertes’
prowess with a sword, which was recently praised before all the
court by a Frenchman who had seen him in combat. The king speculates
that if Hamlet could be tempted into a duel with Laertes, it might
provide Laertes with the chance to kill him. Laertes agrees, and
they settle on a plan. Laertes will use a sharpened sword
rather than the customary dull fencing blade. Laertes also proposes
to poison his sword, so that even a scratch from it will kill Hamlet. The king concocts a backup plan as well, proposing that if Hamlet

for Ophelia. They argue whether Ophelia should be buried in the
churchyard, since her death looks like a suicide. According to religious
doctrine, suicides may not receive Christian burial. The first gravedigger,
who speaks cleverly and mischievously, asks the second gravedigger
a riddle: “What is he that builds stronger than either the mason,
the shipwright, or the carpenter?” ( V.i.46–47). The second gravedigger answers that it must be the gallows-maker,
for his frame outlasts a thousand tenants. The first gravedigger

work. Hamlet looks with wonder at the skulls they excavate to make
room for the fresh grave and speculates darkly about what occupations
the owners of these skulls served in life: “Why may not that be
the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now . . . ?” ( V.i.90–91). Hamlet asks the gravedigger whose grave he digs, and the gravedigger
spars with him verbally, first claiming that the grave is his own,
since he is digging it, then that the grave belongs to no man and
no woman, because men and women are living things and the occupant
of the grave will be dead. At last he admits that it belongs to
one “that was a woman sir; but, rest her soul, she’s dead” (V.i.146). The gravedigger, who does not recognize Hamlet as the prince, tells
him that he has been a gravedigger since King Hamlet defeated the
elder Fortinbras in battle, the very day on which young Prince Hamlet
was born. Hamlet picks up a skull, and the gravedigger tells him
that the skull belonged to Yorick, King Hamlet’s jester. Hamlet
tells Horatio that as a child he knew Yorick and is appalled at
the sight of the skull. He realizes forcefully that all men will
eventually become dust, even great men like Alexander the Great
and Julius Caesar. Hamlet imagines that Julius Caesar has disintegrated and
is now part of the dust used to patch up a wall.",He says that it’s Opheilia’s grave.,He says that it’s Polonius’s grave.,He says that it’s Hamlet’s grave.,He says that it’s his own grave.,3

own life (V.i.242). He and Horatio hide as
the procession approaches the grave. As Ophelia is laid in the earth,
Hamlet realizes it is she who has died. At the same moment, Laertes
becomes infuriated with the priest, who says that to give Ophelia
a proper Christian burial would profane the dead. Laertes leaps
into Ophelia’s grave to hold her once again in his arms. Grief-stricken and
outraged, Hamlet bursts upon the company, declaring in agonized
fury his own love for Ophelia. He leaps into the grave and fights
with Laertes, saying that “forty thousand brothers / Could not,
with all their quantity of love, / make up my sum” (V.i.254–256). Hamlet cries that he would do things for Ophelia that Laertes could
not dream of—he would eat a crocodile for her, he would be buried

courtier. Osric tries to flatter Hamlet by agreeing with everything
Hamlet says, even when he contradicts himself; in the space of seconds,
he agrees first that it is cold, then that it is hot. He has come
to tell them that Claudius wants Hamlet to fence with Laertes and
that the king has made a wager with Laertes that Hamlet will win. Then Osric begins to praise Laertes effusively, though Hamlet and
Horatio are unable to determine what point he is trying to make
with his overly elaborate proclamations. Finally, a lord enters
and asks Hamlet if he is ready to come to the match, as the king
and queen are expecting him. Against Horatio’s advice,
Hamlet agrees to fight, saying that “all’s ill here about my heart,”
but that one must be ready for death, since it will come no matter
what one does (V.ii.222). The court marches
into the hall, and Hamlet asks Laertes for forgiveness, claiming
that it was his madness, and not his own will, that murdered Polonius. Laertes says that he will not forgive Hamlet until an elder, an
expert in the fine points of honor, has advised him in the matter. But, in the meantime, he says, he will accept Hamlet’s offer of

and Guildenstern themselves. He tells Horatio that he has no sympathy
for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who betrayed him and catered to

poured poison into his ear—the very villain who now wears his crown,
Claudius. Hamlet’s worst fears about his uncle are confirmed. “ O

the king to watch a play whose plot closely resembles the murder

alone through the lobby of the castle, and, at such a time, they could
hide behind an arras (a curtain or wall hanging) while Ophelia confronts
Hamlet, allowing them to see for themselves whether Hamlet’s madness
really emanates from his love for her. The king declares that they

on something dangerous in Hamlet’s soul like a bird sits on her
egg, and that he fears what will happen when it hatches. He declares
that he will send Hamlet to England, in the hope that a change of
scenery might help him get over his troubles. Polonius agrees that
this is a good idea, but he still believes that Hamlet’s agitation
comes from loving Ophelia. He asks Claudius to send Hamlet to Gertrude’s

is a powerful, courageous, and well-read man, and also possibly
a dangerous magician. He points out that Glyndwr
has been very tolerant of Hotspur’s youthful obnoxiousness. Anyone else,

As soon as the present civil war is resolved, he says, he wants to lead an army to join the Crusades in Jerusalem; he has prepared everything he will need for this.

He condemns him for his careless, violent, freewheeling life, and he paints a vivid picture of the horrors he thinks England can expect when Hal becomes king. Hal kneels before his father, weeping, and swears that he loves his father and was full of grief when he thought him dead; he says that he views the crown as an enemy to fight with, not as a treasure. King Henry, moved by the speech, lets Hal sit next to him.

We learn that King Henry IV has finally died and that everyone in the castle is frightened of what will happen to them, and to the rule of law, now that Prince Hal is in charge. The Lord Chief Justice, especially, expects nothing but evil to befall him, since he has never shied away from scolding Hal for his violations of the law. Moreover, he is responsible for briefly imprisoning Hal (when Hal struck him once in a dispute), and he is the most despised enemy of Hal's lawless friends, particularly Falstaff.

The lords mourn the dead king, who had ruled England so well and conquered his enemies so bravely. The new king, Henry VI, is still too young to rule in his father's stead, and Gloucester has been named Protector of the kingdom. Gloucester accuses Winchester, a bishop, of not praying enough for their dead king; perhaps if he had tried harder, he could have saved him. But Bedford urges them to stop their quarreling.

Joan replies that they will fight for Orléans, and Charles agrees. Joan announces that she will raise the siege that very day. Glory, she says, is like a circle in the water, expanding infinitely until something stops it. With the death of Henry V, the English circle has ceased to spread; the situation can only improve from here.

Bedford is again preparing to depart when a third messenger enters to tell of a terrible battle between Talbot, the English general, and the French forces. Talbot, when retreating from the siege of Orléans, was surrounded by French troops and fought a hard fight. All the French soldiers were directed to take on Talbot, but none could defeat him, until the cowardly Englishman Sir John Fastolf fled, leaving Talbot open to be captured by the French.",Orléans,Rheims,Paris,Nantes,0

Talbot sees that his son has received his first wound in battle, struck by the Bastard of Orléans. This first penetration by a sword has deflowered this young soldier, Talbot says. He asks if John is tired, urging him again to leave the battlefield. Hasn't he achieved enough glory now to escape with honor and live on to avenge his father's death? Why endanger both their lives on the same bloody field? If he himself dies, he merely cuts off the few short years he has remaining, but if John dies, then the family name dies, along with the revenge of his death, and the connection between English leadership and the Talbot name.",Fight to the death,Flee the scene,Use his horn,Find Joan,1

Talbot says he had sent for his son to teach him the strategies of war so that the name of Talbot might be carried on into future wars.

19210,3 of 5 Why does Talbot’s son John refuse to fight Joan?,"John understands all that his father says, yet he insists that if he flees then he will no longer deserve the name of Talbot's son. If he does possess the name Talbot, his duty is to die at his father's side. Talbot returns with his son to battle, comparing him to Icarus. ( In Greek myth, Icarus and his father Daedalus are trapped in a labyrinth; Daedalus constructs wings for them from feathers and wax so that both may escape; however, Icarus flies too near the sun, his wings melt, and he drowns in the sea.)",Because Joan is too powerful,Because Joan is hidden,Because Joan is a woman,Because Joan is fleeing,2

Charles expresses gladness that York and Somerset's troops never arrived, for the French would not have won had they come as planned. The lords discuss John and how powerful a warrior he proved before he fell.

19233,1 of 5 Which quality is a common characteristic of Shakespeare’s history plays?,"In the modern age, Shakespeare's histories have fallen in popularity behind his tragedies and comedies. Many people, assuming them to be accurate textbook accounts of the events depicted, associate them with tedious story lines or imagine that they must lack dramatically interesting material. But this is not the case. Shakespeare drew on historical records of the times about which he wrote, but he condensed dates and events, reordering things if necessary in order to create dramatic tension and compelling plots. In this play, he makes Henry VI older than he was at the time of his succession; he was actually only nine months old, but in the play is of marriageable age. Moreover, some of the play's most striking scenes are of his own invention, not based in fact: for example, the scene in the Temple Garden, in which the followers of Richard Plantagenet and Somerset pick white and red roses as emblems of their opposing opinions on a point of law. This scene provides an explanation as to the origin of the War of the Roses, an affair whose actual origins are characterized by stultifying complexity and politics, not the spare aesthetic elegance of this scene.",They are completely accurate,They often contain inventions,They are often short,They have few characters,1
19234,2 of 5 Which of the following is a theory of history that Shakespeare gives voice to in 1 Henry VI?,"Shakespeare's ""history,"" then, actually takes the form of drama. Thus, he gives events a variety of different explanations. Without developing any consistent philosophy of history, Shakespeare gives equal voice to two predominant theories on the cause of 15th-century British turmoil: one theory reasons that history is the result of human choices and actions; another posits that a higher power watches and judges our actions and rewards or punishes accordingly--by this theory, the violence of the 15th century came as punishment for Britain's illegal dethroning of Richard II. In this play, some events certainly result from human decisions--and particularly human rivalries, yet we also see evidence of other, higher powers at work, particularly in Talbot's apparently inevitable fall and in Joan's ability to communicate with the supernatural world.",History is caused by chance,History has no meaning,History involves higher powers,Humans can’t control history,2
19235,3 of 5 What animal does Henry use as a metaphor to describe the dissention among his nobles?,"1 Henry VI's plot is driven by conflict.

Then, the argument between York and Somerset, echoing the struggle between Winchester and Gloucester in Henry's court, causes the Englishmen to give inadequate support to Talbot in the battlefield, thus, exacerbating the primary conflict. The message within these court struggles is that petty rivalries and internal divisions among the nobility can be as dangerous to England as French soldiers.

She tells Suffolk that she thought Henry would resemble Suffolk in bravery and seductiveness, but Henry is weak and more concerned with prayer and his religious life. Suffolk tells her to be patient; just as he was the cause of her becoming queen, so he will make things work out for her in England. The two discuss all their enemies, from Beaufort and Gloucester to Somerset, Buckingham, and York, and finally Salisbury and Warwick. Plus, says Margaret, there is the Duchess to worry about; Margaret can't stand the Duchess's haughty manner, behaving as if she is the highest lady in the land. Suffolk says he has set a trap for her already. And while they don't like Beaufort, they must side with him until Gloucester has come to disgrace.

Gloucester determines to heal Simpcox's lameness and calls for a whip to be brought in. Simpcox says he can't stand unaided to be whipped, but after the first blow falls, Simpcox runs off.

explains, the throne cannot be inherited through a mother. That
is, if a king has a daughter, the daughter’s son has no claim to
the throne. But England has no such law (known as Salic law in France),
and kings can inherit the throne through the female line. Because
King Henry’s great-great-grandmother was a daughter of the king
of France, under English law, he would be the rightful heir to the
throne of France. Of course, the French don’t think the same way,
and they believe that their king, Charles VI, is the rightful monarch. If Henry wants to claim France, or even part of it, Canterbury concludes,

at the thought of the perilous ocean sinking his entire investment,
but Antonio assures his friends that his business ventures do not
depend on the safe passage of any one ship. Solanio then declares

19653,5 of 5 What did each of Portia’s suitors do before leaving?,"At Belmont, Portia complains to her lady-in-waiting, Nerissa,
that she is weary of the world because, as her dead father’s will
stipulates, she cannot decide for herself whether to take a husband. Instead,
Portia’s various suitors must choose between three chests, one of
gold, one of silver, and one of lead, in the hopes of selecting the
one that contains her portrait. The man who guesses correctly will
win Portia’s hand in marriage, but those who guess incorrectly must
swear never to marry anyone. Nerissa lists the suitors who have
come to guess—a Neapolitan prince, a Palatine count, a French nobleman,
an English baron, a Scottish lord, and the nephew of the duke of
Saxony—and Portia criticizes their many hilarious faults. For instance,
she describes the Neapolitan prince as being too fond of his horse,
the Palatine count as being too serious, the Englishman as lacking
any knowledge of Italian or any of the other languages Portia speaks,
and the German suitor of drunkenness. Each of these suitors has
left without even attempting a guess for fear of the penalty for
guessing wrong. This fact relieves Portia, and both she and Nerissa
remember Bassanio, who has visited once before, as the suitor most
deserving and worthy of praise. A servant enters to tell Portia
that the prince of Morocco will arrive soon, news that Portia is
not at all happy to hear.",Opened the caskets,Had dinner with Portia,Refused to choose caskets,Chose the wrong casket,2

them. The messenger informs them that Portia will soon return from
the monastery, and Lorenzo and Jessica prepare to greet the mistress
of the house. Launcelot enters and announces that Bassanio will return
to Belmont the next day. Lorenzo calls for music, and he and Jessica
sit on a grassy bank beneath the stars. Lorenzo contemplates the
music made by the movement of heavenly orbs, which mortal humans
cannot hear while alive. The musicians arrive and begin to play,

Gratiano, asking the women to accept his soul should either Bassanio

each of their husbands a ring and suggesting that they exercise
more care in keeping these rings. Bassanio and Gratiano recognize
these as the same rings they gave to the lawyer and his clerk, and
Portia and Nerissa claim that they lay with the gentlemen in order

a beautiful woman. He opens the chest to reveal a skull with a scroll

calls Shylock and Antonio before her. Portia asks Antonio if he
admits to owing Shylock money. When Antonio answers yes, Portia
concludes that the Jew must be merciful. Shylock asks why he must
show mercy, and, in one of the play’s most famous speeches, Portia
responds that “[t]he quality of mercy is not strained,” but is a
blessing to both those who provide and those who receive it (IV.i.179). Because mercy is an attribute of God, Portia reasons, humans approach
the divine when they exercise it. Shylock brushes aside her pretty speech,
however, by reiterating his demands for justice and revenge.",Mercy is a blessing,Shylock will be respected,It is the law,Shylock will feel good,0

own life. Bassanio begs the court to bend the law slightly in order
to exonerate Antonio, reasoning that such a small infraction is
a little wrong for a great right. Portia replies, however, that
the law shall not be broken—the decrees of Venice must stand. Shylock
joyfully extols Portia’s wisdom, and gives her the bond for inspection. She looks it over, declares it legal and binding, and bids Shylock
to be merciful. Shylock remains deaf to reason, however, and Portia
tells Antonio to prepare himself for the knife. She orders Shylock
to have a surgeon on hand to prevent the merchant from bleeding
to death, but Shylock refuses because the bond stipulates no such
safeguard.",Kill Shylock,Give Shylock money,Take Shylock’s knife,Bend the rules,3

a group of common laborers meets at the house of Peter Quince to
rehearse a play that the men hope to perform for the grand celebration
preceding the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta. Quince, a carpenter, tries
to conduct the meeting, but the talkative weaver Nick Bottom continually
interrupts him with advice and direction. Quince tells the group
what play they are to perform: The Most Lamentable Comedy
and Most Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisbe, which tells the
story of two lovers, separated by their parents’ feud, who speak to
each other at night through a hole in a wall. In the play, a lion
surprises Thisbe one night and tatters her mantle before she escapes. When
Pyramus finds the shredded garment, he assumes that the lion has
killed Thisbe; stricken with grief, he commits suicide. When Thisbe
finds Pyramus’s bloody corpse, she too commits suicide. Quince assigns
their parts: Bottom is to play Pyramus; Francis Flute, Thisbe; Robin
Starveling, Thisbe’s mother; Tom Snout, Pyramus’s father; Quince
himself, Thisbe’s father; and Snug, the lion.","They're discussing the food to be served at Theseus""s wedding.",They're writing and rehearsing several songs to honor Theseus.,"They're discussing the repairs that need to be made at Theseus""s palace before his wedding.","They're rehearsing a play that the men hope to perform at Theseus""s wedding.",3

him a wonderful Thisbe and that his ability to roar would make him
a wonderful lion. Quince eventually convinces him that Pyramus is
the part for him, by virtue of the fact that Pyramus is supposed
to be very handsome. Snug worries that he will be unable to learn
the lion’s part, but Quince reassures him that it will be very easy
to learn, since the lion speaks no words and only growls and roars. This worries the craftsmen, who reason that if the lion frightens
any of the noble ladies in the audience, they will all be executed;
since they are only common laborers, they do not want to risk upsetting
powerful people. Bottom says that he could roar
as sweetly as a nightingale so as not to frighten anyone, but Quince
again convinces him that he can only play Pyramus. The group disperses,

Pyramus finds the shredded garment, he assumes that the lion has

announcing that he should be the one to play the assigned part. He says that his ability to speak in a woman’s voice would make
him a wonderful Thisbe and that his ability to roar would make him
a wonderful lion. Quince eventually convinces him that Pyramus is
the part for him, by virtue of the fact that Pyramus is supposed
to be very handsome. Snug worries that he will be unable to learn
the lion’s part, but Quince reassures him that it will be very easy
to learn, since the lion speaks no words and only growls and roars. This worries the craftsmen, who reason that if the lion frightens
any of the noble ladies in the audience, they will all be executed;
since they are only common laborers, they do not want to risk upsetting
powerful people. Bottom says that he could roar
as sweetly as a nightingale so as not to frighten anyone, but Quince
again convinces him that he can only play Pyramus. The group disperses,

play.","They're worried that the audience won""t find the play amusing.",They're worried that the lion will upset the ladies in attendance.,They're worried that no one will pay attention to the performance.,"They're worried that they haven""t been invited by Theseus to attend his wedding.",1

Turkish fleet of ships could not survive the storm, a third gentlemen
comes to confirm his prediction: as his ship traveled from Venice,
Cassio witnessed that the Turks lost most of their fleet in the
tempest. It is still uncertain whether Othello’s ship has been able
to survive the storm. Hope lifts as voices offstage announce the
sighting of a sail offshore, but the new ship turns out to be carrying
Iago, Emilia, Desdemona, and Roderigo. Desdemona disembarks, and
no sooner does Cassio tell her that Othello has yet to arrive than
a friendly shot announces the arrival of a third ship. While the
company waits for the ship, Cassio and Desdemona tease Emilia about
being a chatterbox, but Iago quickly takes the opportunity to criticize
women in general as deceptive and hypocritical, saying they are
lazy in all matters except sex: “You rise to play and
go to bed to work” (II.i.118). Desdemona
plays along, laughing as Iago belittles women, whether beautiful
or ugly, intelligent or stupid, as equally despicable. Cassio takes
Desdemona away to speak with her privately about Othello’s arrival. Iago notices that Cassio takes Desdemona’s hand as he talks to her,
and, in an aside, Iago plots to use Cassio’s hand-holding to frame
him so that he loses his newly gained promotion to lieutenant. “ With

Othello by arguing that it is no crime for a woman to be naked with
a man, if nothing happens. Iago then remarks that if he were to
give his wife a handkerchief, it would be hers to do as she wished
with it. These persistent insinuations of Desdemona’s unfaithfulness
work Othello into an incoherent frenzy. He focuses obsessively on
the handkerchief and keeps pumping Iago for information about Cassio’s comments
to Iago. Finally, Iago says that Cassio has told him he has lain
with Desdemona, and Othello “[f]alls down in a trance” (IV.i.41 stage
direction).",Othello must sail to Turkey and conquer the kingdom.,Othello must dismiss Iago and reinstate Cassio.,Othello must barricade Cyprus and prepare for an attack.,Othello must return to Venice and leave Cassio in charge.,3

about Cassio, and Desdemona irritates Othello by answering Lodovico’s
inquiries. The contents of the letter also upset Othello—he has
been called back to Venice, with orders to leave Cassio as his replacement
in Cyprus. When Desdemona hears the news that she will be leaving
Cyprus, she expresses her happiness, whereupon Othello strikes her. Lodovico is horrified by Othello’s loss of self-control, and asks
Othello to call back Desdemona, who has left the stage. Othello
does so, only to accuse her of being a false and promiscuous woman. He tells Lodovico that he will obey the duke’s orders, commands
Desdemona to leave, and storms off. Lodovico cannot believe that
the Othello he has just seen is the same self-controlled man he
once knew. He wonders whether Othello is mad, but Iago refuses to
answer Lodovico’s questions, telling him that he must see for himself.",Laughs at her,Slaps her,Forgives her,Embraces her,1

replies that he begs her pardon: he took her for the “cunning whore

and sends Desdemona to bed, telling her that he will be with her
shortly and that she should dismiss Emilia. Desdemona seems aware
of her imminent fate as she prepares for bed. She says that if she
dies before Emilia, Emilia should use one of the wedding sheets
for her shroud. As Emilia helps her mistress to undress, Desdemona
sings a song, called “Willow,” about a woman whose love forsook
her. She says she learned the song from her mother’s maid, Barbary,
who died singing the song after she had been deserted by her lover. The song makes Desdemona think about adultery, and she asks Emilia whether
she would cheat on her husband “for all the world” (IV.iii.62). Emilia says that she would not deceive her husband for jewels or
rich clothes, but that the whole world is a huge prize and would
outweigh the offense. This leads Emilia to speak about the fact
that women have appetites for sex and infidelity just as men do, and
that men who deceive their wives have only themselves to blame if
their wives cheat on them. Desdemona replies that she prefers to answer
bad deeds with good deeds rather than with more bad deeds. She readies
herself for bed.",With equally bad deeds,With deeds that are far worse,With no action at all,With good deeds,3

his villainous nature. The citizens complain that it would be better
for the prince to have no uncles than to have uncles struggling
over control of him and the country. They dread what the future

news. He says that Elizabeth’s kinsmen, Rivers and Gray, have been
arrested along with an ally of theirs named Sir Thomas Vaughan. They have been sent to Pomfret, a castle where prisoners are held
and often killed. The order to arrest them came, not surprisingly,
from Richard and his ally, Buckingham. Elizabeth and the duchess
realize that this news probably means the beginning of the end for
their family. They wail for their loss—and for what is to come. Knowing that Richard means her ill, Elizabeth decides to take her
youngest son and flee to sanctuary—to a place where, she hopes,
Richard cannot come after them. The cardinal promises his support

20028,5 of 5 What does Capulet promise Paris,"Capulet, Lady Capulet, and Paris walk together. Capulet
says that because of the terrible recent events, he has had no time
to ask his daughter about her feelings for Paris. Lady Capulet states
that she will know her daughter’s thoughts by the morning. Paris
is about to leave when Capulet calls him back and makes what he
calls “a desperate tender of my child’s love” (3.4.12–13). Capulet says he thinks his daughter will listen to him, then corrects
himself and states that he is sure Juliet will abide by his decision. He promises Paris that the wedding will be held on Wednesday, then
stops suddenly and asks what day it is. Paris responds that it is
Monday; Capulet decides that Wednesday is too soon, and that the
wedding should instead be held on Thursday.",That Paris will marry Juliet on Thursday,That Paris can take vengeance on Romeo,That Paris will one day control Verona,That Paris can attend Tybalt's funeral,0
20029,1 of 5 What does Juliet claim is making the birdcalls they hear,"Just before dawn, Romeo prepares to lower himself from
Juliet’s window to begin his exile. Juliet tries to convince Romeo
that the birdcalls they hear are from the nightingale, a night bird,
rather than from the lark, a morning bird. Romeo cannot entertain
her claims; he must leave before the morning comes or be put to
death. Juliet declares that the light outside comes not from the
sun, but from some meteor. Overcome by love, Romeo responds that
he will stay with Juliet, and that he does not care whether the
Prince’s men kill him. Faced with this turnaround, Juliet declares
that the bird they heard was the lark; that it is dawn and he must
flee. The Nurse enters to warn Juliet that Lady Capulet is approaching. Romeo and Juliet tearfully part. Romeo climbs out the window. Standing
in the orchard below her window, Romeo promises Juliet that they
will see one another again, but Juliet responds that he appears
pale, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. Romeo answers that, to
him, she appears the same way, and that it is only sorrow that makes
them both look pale. Romeo hurries away as Juliet pulls in the ladder
and begs fate to bring him back to her quickly.",A lark,A dove,A sparrow,A nightingale,3

her mother would come to speak to her so early in the morning. Unaware
that her daughter is married to Romeo, Lady Capulet enters the room
and mistakes Juliet’s tears as continued grief for Tybalt. Lady
Capulet tells Juliet of her deep desire to see “the villain Romeo”
dead (3.5.80). In a complicated bit of
punning every bit as impressive as the sexual punning of Mercutio
and Romeo, Juliet leads her mother to believe that she also wishes
Romeo’s death, when in fact she is firmly stating her love for him. Lady Capulet tells Juliet about Capulet’s plan for her to marry
Paris on Thursday, explaining that he wishes to make her happy. Juliet is appalled. She rejects the match, saying “I will not marry
yet; and when I do, I swear / It shall be Romeo—whom you know I
hate— / Rather than Paris” (3.5.121–123). Capulet enters the chamber. When he learns of Juliet’s determination
to defy him he becomes enraged and threatens to disown Juliet if
she refuses to obey him. When Juliet entreats her mother to intercede,
her mother denies her help.",Like they are already dead and in a tomb,Like they did at their marriage,Like they did at their first meeting,Like they are old before their time,0

says, and Romeo is as good as dead anyhow. Though disgusted by her
nurse’s disloyalty, Juliet pretends to agree, and tells her nurse
that she is going to make confession at Friar Lawrence’s. Juliet
hurries to the friar, vowing that she will never again trust the Nurse’s

Romeo describes a wonderful dream he had the night before: Juliet
found him lying dead, but she kissed him, and breathed new life
into his body. Just then, Balthasar enters, and Romeo greets him
happily, saying that Balthasar must have come from Verona with news
of Juliet and his father. Romeo comments that nothing can be ill
in the world if Juliet is well. Balthasar replies that
nothing can be ill, then, for Juliet is well: she is in heaven,
found dead that morning at her home. Thunderstruck, Romeo cries
out “Then I defy you, stars” (5.1.24).",He has received news of the Friar's plan.,He had a dream about Juliet.,He just got a letter from Juliet.,His banishment has been lifted.,1

says that Romeo seems so distraught that he is afraid to leave him,
but Romeo insists. Romeo suddenly stops and asks if Balthasar is
carrying a letter from Friar Lawrence. Balthasar says he is not,
and Romeo sends his servant on his way. Once Balthasar is gone,
Romeo says that he will lie with Juliet that night. He goes to find
an apothecary, a seller of drugs. After telling the man in the shop
that he looks poor, Romeo offers to pay him well for a vial of poison. The Apothecary says that he has just such a thing, but that selling
poison in Mantua carries the death sentence. Romeo replies that
the Apothecary is too poor to refuse the sale. The Apothecary finally
relents and sells Romeo the poison. Once alone, Romeo speaks to
the vial, declaring that he will go to Juliet’s tomb and kill himself.",Juliet married Paris.,Juliet is dead.,Mercutio is still alive.,Benvolio killed himself.,1

how Romeo responded to his letter (which described the plan involving Juliet’s

letter because he was shut up in a quarantined house due to an outbreak
of plague. Friar Lawrence becomes upset, realizing that if Romeo
does not know about Juliet’s false death, there will be no one to
retrieve her from the tomb when she awakes. ( He does not know that
Romeo has learned of Juliet’s death and believes it to be real.) Sending
for a crowbar, Friar Lawrence declares that he will have to rescue
Juliet from the tomb on his own. He sends another letter to Romeo

Tybalt or Juliet. In a rage, Paris accosts Romeo. Romeo

kinsmen: Mercutio and Paris. Capulet and Montague clasp hands and
agree to put their vendetta behind them. Montague says that he will
build a golden statue of Juliet, and Capulet insists that he will

about physically conquering Montague men and sexually conquering

a noble kinsman of the Prince. The two discuss Paris’s desire to
marry Capulet’s daughter, Juliet. Capulet is overjoyed, but also

him as a suitor, and invites Paris to the traditional masquerade
feast he is holding that very night so that Paris might begin to
woo Juliet and win her heart. Capulet dispatches a servant, Peter,

garden, asks why Romeo must be Romeo—a Montague, and therefore an
enemy to her family. She says that if he would refuse his Montague
name, she would give herself to him; or if he would simply swear
that he loved her, she would refuse her Capulet name. Romeo responds
to her plea, surprising Juliet, since she thought she was alone. She wonders how he found her and he tells her that love led him
to her. Juliet worries that Romeo will be murdered if he is found
in the garden, but Romeo refuses to budge, claiming that Juliet’s

for the wedding of Kate and Petruchio. The groom, however, is late,
and Baptista has begun to worry. Kate frets that Petruchio habitually woos
women only to leave them standing at the altar, and she runs off
in tears. Just then, Biondello rushes in to announce that the groom
is on his way, dressed in a ridiculous, mismatched, and shabby costume,
riding up the street on an old, broken-down horse riddled with diseases. Grumio rides at his side, similarly attired. When Petruchio finally
arrives, the crowd, horrified, sees that Biondello’s description
was accurate. Baptista begs him to change into a more fashionable
outfit before marrying Kate, in order to avoid further public humiliation. Petruchio says he will do no such thing and rides off to find Kate
at the church. Most of the crowd follows in a kind of horrified
fascination.",Hit the priest,Swear loudly,Kiss Katherine,Throw food,2

the status of their plan to win Bianca. Tranio informs his master
that they must find a father for him, and Lucentio suggests that
the simplest solution may be for them to elope. They do not speak
for long before Gremio returns to tell the story of what happened
at the marriage. Apparently, Petruchio swore at the altar, struck
the priest, threw food, and, in general, proved such an embarrassment
that Gremio felt compelled to leave early. The marriage has been
completed nonetheless, and the rest of the company soon arrives. However, before they can even begin the wedding feast, Petruchio
announces that he must leave at once and take Kate with him, not
even giving her time to receive congratulations from her friends
and family. At this ridiculous suggestion, Kate tries
to draw the line, saying she will leave only when she wishes, but

that anyone from Mantua found in Padua shall be put to death. The
pedant, frightened out of his wits, promises a favor to Tranio in exchange

they are depriving her for her own benefit. Finally, Petruchio and
Hortensio bring her a meal. ( Hortensio has apparently arrived from
Padua sometime in the last few days to educate himself at Petruchio’s
“taming-school.”) Kate has little time to eat before Petruchio’s
tailor arrives. The tailor has prepared elegant and expensive clothes
for their journey back to Baptista’s house in Padua. Predictably,
Petruchio finds fault with everything that Kate likes, from the
cap to the gown, and he blames the tailor for poor craftsmanship. The tailor tries to deflect the blame onto Grumio, but Petruchio
and Grumio indignantly force him to leave. Petruchio, however, secretly
tells Hortensio to pull the tailor aside and tell him that he will
be paid the following day, revealing that Petruchio’s distasteful
treatment of the tailor is in jest. Petruchio then tells Kate that
they will leave at once for Padua in the clothes that they have
on, planning to arrive at noon. But, when Kate tells Petruchio that
noontime has already passed, he angrily responds that, yet again,
she is contradicting him. He declares that they will not go that

to kill his brother. He rationalizes this scheme by explaining that
Claribel, who is now Queen of Tunis, is too far from Naples to inherit
the kingdom should her father die, and as a result, Sebastian would be
the heir to the throne. Sebastian begins to warm to the idea, especially
after Antonio tells him that usurping Prospero’s dukedom was the

place to be and that they are all lucky to have survived. Alonso finally
brings the repartee to a halt when he bursts out at Gonzalo and
openly expresses regret at having married away his daughter in Tunis. Francisco, a minor lord, pipes up at this point that he saw Ferdinand
swimming valiantly after the wreck, but this does not comfort Alonso. Sebastian and Antonio continue to provide little help. Sebastian

It quickly becomes apparent that the couple is deeply in love, but Perdita expresses concern over the possibility of their eventual union, pointing out that Florizel's father is bound to oppose it. The prince reassures her, declaring that ""I'll be thine, my fair, / Or not my father's""(IV.iv.42-43). As they talk together, the Shepherd comes in with a huge crowd, including the Clown, a group of shepherdesses, and the disguised Polixenes and Camillo. The Shepherd tells his adoptive daughter to act the hostess, as is proper, and so she busies herself distributing flowers to the new arrivals, which leads to a discussion of horticulture with Polixenes. Watching and listening to her, Florizel is inspired to another effusive declaration of his love. At this point we learn that he is going by the alias of Doricles./PARAGRAPH Polixenes remarks to Camillo that Perdita is ""the prettiest lowborn lass that ever / ran on the greensward. Nothing she does or seems / But smacks of something greater than herself, too noble for this place""(IV.iv.156-59). He asks the Shepherd about ""Doricles,"" and the Shepherd tells him that his daughter's suitor is some high-born fellow, and that the two are deeply in love—""I think there is not half a kiss to choose / Who loves another best""(IV.iv.175-76). Meanwhile, a peddler arrives, with the promise of entertaining the company with songs. He is allowed in—it is Autolycus, in a peddler's costume—and sets about selling ballads to the Clown and the shepherdesses, and then singing for the entire group. As he does so, Polixenes asks Florizel why he has not bought anything for his love, and the prince replies that he knows that Perdita does not desire such silly things as the peddler is offering. He then decides to take this moment to ask the Shepherd to seal their betrothal, and the old man gladly agrees to do so./PARAGRAPH Before they make the compact, however, Polixenes asks Florizel why he does not consult his father before getting engaged, and the prince (still unaware of whom he is speaking with) replies that there are reasons, which he dares not share, why his father cannot know of his betrothal. He urges the Shepherd to ""mark our contract""(IV.iv.16), but the king now casts aside his disguise and declares that the betrothal shall not go forward: the Shepherd will be executed for allowing a prince to court his daughter; Perdita's beauty shall be ""scratched with briers""(Iv.iv.424); and Florizel will be disinherited if he ever speaks of her again. He relents slightly, after a moment, and decides to spare the life of the Shepherd and the face of his daughter, but tells them that if they ever see the prince again, there lives will be forfeit. Polixenes then departs, ordering his son to follow him to court, and leaving everyone horrified.",She will be executed,Her face will be scratched,She will be sent away,She will marry Camillo,1

Seeing an opportunity for mischief, he pretends to be a nobleman (he is still wearing Florizel's clothing). The Clown is advising the Shepherd to tell King Polixenes how he found Perdita in the forest years before—since if she was a foundling, he is not her real father and therefore not responsible for her actions. Hearing this, Autolycus tells them that the king has gone aboard a nearby ship, and sends them in that direction. In fact, he sends them to the ship that Florizel and Perdita are taking to Sicilia.",Perdita,Polixenes,Autolycus,Florizel,3

While they discuss this problem, with Camillo promising to furnish the necessary attendants and letters, Autolycus comes in, bragging to himself about all the cheap goods he sold and all the purses he stole during the sheepshearing. Noticing him, Camillo asks the rascal to exchange clothes with Florizel. Autolycus, baffled, agrees, and the prince puts on the peddler's rags, which, he hopes, will enable him to reach a ship undetected by his father. This done, Florizel, Perdita, and Camillo leave Autolycus alone on stage. The crafty peddler/thief declares that he has figured out their business from listening to them, but will not go and tell the king, since that would be a good deed—and good deeds are against his nature.",Florizel,Camillo,Shepherd,Perdita,1
